    <para>ClamAV is an open source (GPL) antivirus engine designed for detecting Trojans,
        viruses, malware and other malicious threats. It provides a high performance mutli-threaded
        scanning daemon, command line utilities for on demand file scanning, and an intelligent tool
        for automatic signature updates. The core ClamAV library provides numerous file format
        detection mechanisms, file unpacking support, archive support, and multiple signature
        languages for detecting threats. The core ClamAV library is utilized in Immunet 3.0, powered
        by ClamAV, which is a fast, fully featured Desktop AV solution for Windows.

        >Stefan Seyfried: OpenStack “bexar” packages for openSUSE and SLES11SP1 are
      ready</ulink></title>
    <para>Shortly after the <ulink url="https://launchpad.net/~openstack">OpenStack “bexar”</ulink>
      (spoken “bear”) release was ready, my packages finished building and are available at <ulink
        url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/B1-Systems:/OpenStack/">the
        isv:B1-Systems:OpenStack</ulink> Build Service repo. </para>
    <para>Grab them, while they are still hot! </para>
    <para>The ride might still be a bit bumpy as the whole OpenStack development is very Ubuntu
      centric, and thus some of the dependencies, especially to old versions of python stuff are
      tricky to find. However, first results look promising. </para>
    <para>I’ll update here soon with some short hints on how to configure and use the whole lot. </para>
    <para>Thanks go to my colleagues Christian Berendt and Andre Nähring at B1 Systems GmbH who have
      been tireless in testing packages and reporting packaging bugs and other problems. Thanks also
      to Gregory Haskins with whom I started the packaging effort early in december.</para>

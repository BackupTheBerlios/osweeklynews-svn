      <para>The read command is designed to read and then use in the script input from the user. The

        will store one line of input from the user in one or more variables. The read command is
        valuable as it is a major way to input information into a shell script. Lines are read into
        the script with standard input and split via the $IFS variable. This stands for internal
        field separator. The first word is assigned the first variable, the second word the second
        variable, etc. (...)</para>

        The perfect transport simulation</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>So many opens. The thing is, it's been almost five years since my last openTTD <ulink
        url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/games/openttd_review.html">review</ulink>. Many things have
      changed. The most important of those is the fact you don't need the <ulink
        url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/games/reviving/openttd.html">old</ulink> data files from the
      original Transport Tycoon game to be able to play OpenTTD anymore. The major release version
      1.0 offers <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/games/reviving/openttd-graphics.html"
        >free</ulink> alternative graphics and sounds as good as the original. This means anyone can
      play and enjoy this fabulous title. </para>
    <para>Five years had flown past, but the game remains as fun as ever. Simply timeless. Well,
      it's time for another review. I'll pretend I've not written an article before and just give
      you yet another lovely, pleasant scoop on one of the finest strategy games even created. Not
      without a reason is it <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/games/linux-games-best.html"
        >listed</ulink> as my favorite Linux pick for 2010. </para>

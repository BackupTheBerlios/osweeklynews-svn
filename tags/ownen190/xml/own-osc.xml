    <para>Just like at last years conference, this years openSUSE conference will also feature a
      keysigning party, read on to find out how to participate and what to do. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">What is a Keysigning Party (KSP) </emphasis></para>
    <para>A key signing party is a get-together of people who use the PGP encryption system with the
      purpose of allowing those people to sign each others keys. Key signing parties serve to extend
      the web of trust to a great degree. Key signing parties also serve as great opportunities to
      discuss the political and social issues surrounding strong cryptography, individual liberties,
      individual sovereignty, and even implementing encryption technologies or perhaps future work
      on free encryption software. (...)</para>

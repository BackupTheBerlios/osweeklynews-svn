      Handbrake is an extensive tool to rip DVD's to another file format, amongst other things it can do. The starter of this thread is looking for support in using it, embedding a problem he has with regard to mounting DVD's. A lot of members jump in with advice. A good read for those interested in the features and possibilities of this excellent tool.

      This is one of the threads in the forums on issues with the Chromium, Google's browser, packages. We decided to warn users not to upgrade, since the released versions (by Google) resulted in broken packages, i.e. software not working as it should. Thanks to the cooperation of some of our memnbers and the interaction with one of the packagers, this didn't last long. If you experience problems with Chromium read this thread, also search the forums for "Chromium" to find the other threads on this subject.

      This one opens rather funny, if you don't have the problem on your own hardware. Any keystroke of the poster's laptop is picked up by the microphone, and audible through the speakers. It ends with "Well done oldcpu. Bleeding edge but encouraging, and another satisfied user"...

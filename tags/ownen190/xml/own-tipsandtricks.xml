      </title>
      <para>One of the best features of Gnome 3 are the dynamic workspaces. Using some simple <ulink url="http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson/blog/archive/2011/05/25/efficient-application-switching-with-gnome-3.aspx">keyboard shortcuts</ulink>, it is possible to assign an application to a workspace and quickly switch between them. If you run a standard set of applications, this process makes switching between them very efficient.</para>
      <para>The problem with running applications in their own workspace is that you have to spend some time once Gnome 3 has booted moving the applications to their proper workspaces. However, using a tool called <ulink url="http://www.foosel.org/linux/devilspie">devilspie</ulink>, it is possible to setup a script that will automatically rearrange your windows for you.

      <para>Inkscape is the premier open source vector graphics editor for Linux. Inkscape is cross platform and is available for Windows and Mac OS X for free download. We have dealt with a bunch of really good <ulink url="http://www.techdrivein.com/2010/10/13-beautiful-inkscape-tutorials-for.html">Inskcape tutorials</ulink> before, here are even more of those. Following is a collection of 10 of the very best and descriptive Inkscape tutorials from around the web. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>In the last few tutorials we have been looking at various parts of what make up a graphical user interface.   We’ve created labels and buttons and have attached images to a label (and a button if you did the homework).  We have also associated an action with pressing a button.   In this tutorial we’re going to put these together to make a simple image viewer application.  As with the previous tutorials, this will only work with images which are saved as a “gif” format.  Also, a word of warning – you need to do pretty much all of the code before any of it will work.</para>
      <para>Here are some images for you to use.  As with the earlier tutorial, you can either use ‘save as’ to download a copy, or you can use the Python code in the note below to download them (if you use Python you should be in your python4kids directory when you do the download otherwise the files will get saved somewhere else).  A gold star if you use Python for the download. (...)</para>

      <para>You’re probably familiar with the popular proprietary commercial package Norton Ghost.
        The problem with these kind of software packages is that it takes a lot of time to massively
        clone systems to many computers. You’ve probably also heard of Symantec’s solution to this
        problem, Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition with multicasting. Well, now there is an
        OpenSource clone system (OCS) solution called Clonezilla with unicasting and multicasting!

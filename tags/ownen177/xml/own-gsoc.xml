        Ready…Set…Code!</ulink></title>
    <para>Yesterday marked the official start of Google Summer of Code’s Coding Period. And openSUSE
      mentors are right in the thick of it working with 16 students seeking to make a better world
      in FOSS.</para>
    <para>openSUSE can take particular pride in GSoC further supporting the openSUSE goal of
      creating an environment thatý supports not only openSUSE but FOSS in general. Indeed we are
      mentoring several projects that directly benefit openSUSE, but there’s also several projects
      that support other projects, like the Arch Linux backend for our Open Build Service, a test
      suite for btrfs, ext4 snapshots in snapper, PackageKit backend in Software Center, and ICC
      device profile repository.<blockquote>
        <para>I do believe that our main contribution is that we will be sharing our enthusiasm
          about Free Software with our students and students from other organizations. And this is
          what will, hopefully, keep the students involved in the Free Software world after GSoC.
          <emphasis role="italic">– Vincent Untz, openSUSE GSoC Organizer</emphasis></para>
      </blockquote>And it is true that students are already experiencing the spirit of the openSUSE
      Project. As student Alex Eftimie says:</para>
    <para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>What can I say? I’m excited about everything. openSUSE is the perfect umbrella for
          such a project. What I like most about it is that the result will be usable in a
          cross-distro fashion. Until GSoC, I wasn’t familiar with openSUSE efforts on
          collaboration. Package management is a domain where distros can do better, and I’m glad to
          be a part of this effort.</para>

    <para>Pavol Rusnak, our other openSUSE GSoC organizer, reminds us that there are also some
      long-standing tasks directly beneitting the openSUSE Project which will now be tackled by some
      of our student projects.</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>With projects like Open Build Service for Android, a new python OBS library, and
        solutions to enhance SUSE Studio and YaST, we’ll be further strengthening some of the unique
        selling points of openSUSE.</para>

    <para>as a part of our Google Summer of Code Project to cleanup osc our first task was to define
      a new commandline user interface for osc. The current user interface is quite “inconsistent”
      (with regard to the expected arguments for different commands) and has some other “flaws”.
      Here are some examples to show some flaws of the current user interface: (...)</para>

        2011: ssc - Week 1</ulink></title>
    <para>My proposal for a command-line client for Suse Studio has been accepted for this year’s
      Google Summer of Code. You can see the full proposal <ulink
        url="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/ratan/1"
        >here</ulink>. In short, the project is pretty self-evident from the title. In case you
      don’t know what Suse Studio is, its a web service that allows you to design custom ISOs of
      linux distributions. As you can imagine, designing a custom variant of a linux distro will
      involve a lot of configuration. This tool aims to ease the hassles involved with using the web
      interface to make these customisations. The most common use case for this tool as I see it
      will be modifying default configuration files. The tool will allow you to make all the
      modifications you want locally in an appliance directory and push the changes when you’re
      ready. If you want a more thorough view of how it will work please do read the <ulink

        >Christos Bountalis: A utility for merging configuration / sysconfig files – Week 1
        Report</ulink></title>
    <para>It’s less than a week, that GSoC 2011 coding period have begun. This is my first report
      for the project.Every Friday I will make a report in this blog to share with you the progress
      I am making on the project.So what did I do during these first days?</para>
    <para>First of all I created an online repo on GitHub and I forked the Augeas project. That will
      permit me to use version control of my project “GIT” during the implementation and retain an
      online repo where I can commit my changes to, while experimenting with the source code. This
      gave me the opportunity to practice more with git, create branches merge commit changes etc. I
      have to admit that until now, I didn’t used a version control system much, but i really don’t
      know why?!?! Really git is awesome and can save the developer valuable and useful time.</para>
    <para>Next, I continued with trying out OBS for the first time, the openSUSE Build Service, that
      just renamed to Open Build Service. Even thought i faced some troubles in the start finding my
      way around (packaging was a new thing for me, and after using obs I have to say that it is not
      as hard as I initially believed), with the help of my mentor I think I can understand now
      better the service and use it. But why use OBS to package so early in the project? Well we
      thought that by using obs we will be able to create packages (please care they are
      experimental ) with the changes i make, so other people can try them out if they are
      interested and maybe help with future debugging.</para>
    <para>Finally among my initial experiments with Augeas source code, I have created a branch
      “helloworld” on my git repo, whether i added a simple hw – Hello world command in the augtool
      that is contained within Augeas. That command prints as you may have guessed <inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata
            fileref="http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1256405099g"/>
        </imageobject>
      </inlinemediaobject> , a hello world message on screen. Then i compiled the project by using
      the sources of the specific branch, and at the end i used obs to create some packages that can
      be found on my obs repo <inlinemediaobject>

        </imageobject>
      </inlinemediaobject> .</para>
    <para>As I had not any important experience with building software and packages, I occupied
      myself this week mainly with administration actions. Which however, will help the community
      and of course everyone interested in my gsoc project, to follow the changes, make suggestions,
      and contribute with new ideas, but will also help in the latter phase of integrating</para>

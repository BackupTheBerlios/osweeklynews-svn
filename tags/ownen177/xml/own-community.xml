      <para>The openSUSE community booth was one of the largest in the organization and
        except the dvds, posters,, flyers, cheat-sheets etc. we co-hosted the booth of the Greek
        community of Gnome, the Enlightenment Project and the amazing people of other communities who
        were there to assist and promote their favorite project and FOSS in general.</para>
      <para>On Saturday evening the openSUSE community had a Release party for the distribution of
        openSUSE 11.4 at the hotel where we resided. The party achieved its purpose because, apart
        from the cake we ate and the beer we drunk, we came closer to people from other communities
        such as the Ubuntu, Slackware, Gentoo, FreeBSD and OS-arena. At the end of the night Red Hat
        people visited our party, with whom we shared the same roof (hotel). :P</para>
      <para>The workshop ended with a farewell message from the organizers of Fosscomm whom we thank
        for the wonderful organization even though the misfortunes of the second day which left us
        without power and wifi internet access for the most part.</para>

      <para>I’m 32 and live in the Boston area. I’ve been working on Linux since 1999 and with SUSE
        since 2000. I started working with Linux by just hacking on small things and then moving on
        to specialize in file systems. These days I lead one of the SUSE Labs kernel teams, still
        focus on file systems, but also am involved in the technical leadership for the kernel in
        all SUSE and openSUSE products.</para>

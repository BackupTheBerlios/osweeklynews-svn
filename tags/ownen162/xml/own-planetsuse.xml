    <para>It was my first time I mentored a couple of students <xref linkend="fig.mensch"/>during a
      Google sponsored project. It was possible to submit non-coding tasks as well. So I focused on
      promo stuff. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Results </emphasis></para>
    <para>Over all I submitted ten tasks (nine could be closed). </para>
    <para>The first block of tasks (solved by Todor Stoyanov and Paul) was about the creation of a
        <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Material/OpenContent">free/open content
        collection</ulink> that could be shown during demos and presentations or could be integrated
      into live CD/DVDs. </para>
    <para>The second block of task was covering KDE and FLOSS in the area of education (solved by
      TheOne and Giannis Konstantinidis). It started with a <ulink
        url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/SchoolSurvey">survey of needs of students</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/SchoolSurveyResult">doing the survey</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Schools/StudentTasks">analyzing student
        tasks</ulink> and ended with a <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Schools">concept
        for students</ulink> how to promote KDE and FLOSS at their school (incl. <ulink
        url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6538846/KDE_marketing_material.zip">promo material</ulink> e.g.
        <ulink url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6538846/KDE_poster.tar.gz">a poster</ulink>, <ulink

        >presentation</ulink>, <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Schools/TalkingPoints"
        >talking points</ulink> for students etc.). One of the students is going to test it within
      his school. Isn't that rocking? </para>
    <para>I truly believe that KDE and FLOSS (esp. KDE EDU and the openSUSE based Desktop4Education
      and Server4Education projects) have so much to offer for schools and students. We should do
      even more in this area. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Challenges </emphasis></para>
    <para>For me it was very difficult to set the level and the time needed to fulfill the task when
      I was submitting it. It depends so much on the skills and the age of the student. The task to
      find free music and test it with Amarok (support for CD cover, lyrics and Wikipedia
      information) would be easy for a student with installed KDE and with some experiences with
      free and open stuff. A student new to the open source world will need days to work out that
      (for him) difficult task. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Summary</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>All in all it was much more work than I expected, on the other side it was a wonderful
      experience to see how the students developed themselves over time (and how fast the tasks were
      taken). It was a great success and I am looking forward to the next time. </para>
    <para>@my students: Thanks for your contribution. It was a great pleasure to work with you.
      Let's keep in touch. Let's keep on rocking the world!</para>

    <para>openSUSE has developed both great infrastructure technology and a powerful enduser
      product; where is it going now? </para>
    <para>Over 5 years ago Novell decided to turn their new asset, SuSE Linux into a community
      distribution. It was a long and laborious process but since almost 2 years now the development
      processes have been opened up to the community. We now speak of openSUSE, a community which is
      now searching for it's direction. The project has state-of-the-art infrastructure at its
      disposal and develops a modern, stable and powerful linux distribution. Meanwhile,
      communication and marketing are it's weak points - innovative technologies like the openSUSE
      Build Service and SUSE Studio do not get the exposure they deserve. In this talk an overview
      is given of openSUSE's history, the developments in the community and the latest openSUSE
      technology is presented.</para>

    <para>In the first half of 2009 the Preload department at Novell was building a team in Taiwan.
      There were two main reasons for this – our customers (the OEMs and ODMs) were located there
      and we wanted to be near them and the first question a customer in Taiwan always seemed to be
      “how many people do you have here”. Local support in the native language backed with a large
      team is very important to companies in Taiwan. </para>
    <para>We hired excellent people who were both experienced Linux engineers and people straight
      out of university. However, all were pretty inexperienced working with open source communities
      and I had a perception that any previous workplaces they were at in Asia was more likely to be
      hierarchical in nature where open communication was discouraged because you don’t question the
      boss. I believe this type of work place leads to the surfacing of issues until its way too
      late to solve them and leads to sub-optimal problem solving. I wanted to ensure that the new
      team understood open source was a key component of our work and that open communication was
      important both internally and externally in support of this. </para>
    <para>This type of situation is not one I would have thought about at all when I first became a
      manager, but a couple of prior experiences (including failure) suggested this was something I
      could and should address. In particular the OpenOffice “indoctrination” about 4 years ago when
      we were expanding the team. At that time I managed the OpenOffice team at Novell and <ulink
        url="http://people.gnome.org/~michael/">Michael Meeks</ulink> interviewed everyone we hired
      during the expansion and many of them spent 1-2 nights sleeping on his couch in the UK or
      getting trained in the Toronto office in person. Due to this, that team (now the team working
      on <ulink url="http://bit.ly/e60nXF">LibreOffice</ulink>) to this day cares a lot about
      tenacious fixing of customer problems, reducing code duplication/bloat and particularly about
      building a great community around the project. </para>
    <para>So for Taiwan <ulink url="http://www.kroah.com/log/">Greg KH</ulink>, Michael Meeks,
        <ulink url="http://bit.ly/f7rQXN">Aaron Bockover</ulink> and Stefan Dirsch all visited the
      office within a year to cover engaging with community, supportability (no one time throw away
      code here!), upstreaming commitment to debug and find the real root cause and more. This had
      two major benefits. First the culture of open source and open investigation into problems was
      transmitted by people who lived it. Second communication pathways were built so that the
      engineering team in Taiwan felt comfortable asking questions and had people they had met to
      ask the questions to, without needing “big boss” (me) to facilitate or hear potentially “dumb”
      questions. So what do we have now? Those previously inexperienced with open source engineers
      who are now <ulink url="http://bit.ly/eTVRqt">proposing</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://bit.ly/go4W1V">submitting</ulink> and <ulink url="http://bit.ly/hL5CQ9"
        >maintaining</ulink>
      <ulink url="http://bit.ly/fcpdvq">code</ulink> upstream. </para>
    <para>(BTW Greg is really great at the kernel piece of this and was able to help <ulink
        url="http://bit.ly/iih0G8">Ralink in a similar manner</ulink> with these two items as well –
      in fact Novell is happy to help any component vendor this way). </para>
    <para>Don’t get me wrong, you can’t just hire anyone and expect to imbue them with your
      organization’s culture, you have to have to get people that are interested in and receptive to
      the culture. For instance its unlikely every single Facebook engineer was previously part of a
      culture of shared code base ownership and review that required them to be <ulink
        url="http://bit.ly/hVntIJ">in the room to fix bugs on the fly or allowed them to change and
        submit code to any part of the app or required checkin review</ulink>. These are cultural
      pieces that are transmitted post hire, but you still have to pick people who are in general
      receptive to that culture. </para>
    <para>I will always think about training engineering people in a cultural context not just in a
      technical manner now, particularly when building new teams or offices since it will be tougher
      for them to get it by osmosis. Future communication connections are built and you display the
      culture you have and want to have in the organization.</para>

    <para>As many people will know I&apos;ve spent around 18 months of my spare time packaging
      and building the Netbook UX for Moblin/MeeGo on openSUSE. Not on my own, but with a
      community around me. I would just like to say a huge thank you to that community,
      you&apos;ve been great and spurred me on when I felt like the whole world was conspiring
      against me. </para>
    <para>Sound a bit morose? Well in a way it is. Basically by all accounts MeeGo is stopping
      all work on the Netbook UX. Yup, all our hard work is now almost for nothing :-( </para>
    <para>The first piece of evidence is the <ulink
      url="http://wiki.meego.com/Release_Engineering/Plans/1.2">Release Engineering Plans for
      1.2</ulink>. If you look at the bottom, you&apos;ll notice that the Netbook doesn&apos;t
      get any mention in Features, just bugs. Actually the same is for the 1.1 release. In all
      honesty, the biggest change between 1.1 and its predecessor is that all refernces to
      Moblin was replaced with MeeGo. The next piece of info came at the fabulous FOSDEM XI
      (I&apos;ll do a seperate post on the event later). I spoke to several people directly and
      indirectly involved with MeeGo, especially the Netbook UX, about the lack of info on the
      Netbook UX. Each one of them said the same thing - MeeGo is putting the Netbook UX into
      Maintanence Mode, stopping any further development on it, and only providing bug fixes for
      major issues. I asked if there was going to be any announcement, basically the answer was
      nothing official. They&apos;re just going to let it drift away - just like netbooks
      themselves have. </para>
    <para>There are most likely a huge number of reasons, which is fair enough. I was given a
      couple of reasons - 1: Netbooks arent selling anymore, the Netbook ship didn&apos;t really
      sail away, but was sunk. 2: MeeGo doesn&apos;t want to invest anymore time or effort in
      gtk development, and wants to concentrate on Qt. Now I take this last one with a tiny bit
      of salt, only because both Intel and Nokia employ (or at least did so) a sizable team of
      GNOME developers. Saying that though, if they want to keep a roof over their heads they
      have to do what their employer says, and both originally started working with touch
      devices. So it does make sense as much as it doesn&apos;t. </para>
    <para>So, I herby give immediate notice that I am now no longer going to be doing any
      further work on the MeeGo UX for openSUSE or anyone else. I wont delete the repo for 1.0
      but will clear out the 1.1 and 1.2 repos that I had - might as well give those resources
      back :-) . Now if anyone would like to continue what I and others had started, then let me
      know and I would be more than happy. </para>
    <para>I cant say what the other distros are going to do, I&apos;ve spoken to my counter part
      in Fedora, and they&apos;re having a think about it as they were busting their chops to
      get things in for the F15 release. Either way I wish all involved luck. </para>
    <para>Now before any of you conspiracy theory junkies get worked up - this has nothing to do
      with the whole MeeGo Trademark issue that Smeegol had with the Linux Foundation. As it
      happens I was due to have a conversation with the Linux Foundation about the issues
      between us and them, but have had to re-schedule due to travel constraints from one party
      or the other. I still intend to speak with the LF about the issues, as they are still
      present in the other UX&apos;s that they are developing. </para>
    <para>So it&apos;s time for me to close off and say, so long and thanks for all the fish!
      I&apos;ll still be around, I&apos;ll probably start getting back into the GNOME swing of
      things, and help fcrozat with GNOME3 etc. Oh and I&apos;ve got a lunatic idea for a
      project which I intend to kick off (stay tuned ;-) ). </para>

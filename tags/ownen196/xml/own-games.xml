        Arena: Xonotic - Free Shooter Based Off Nexuiz</ulink>
    </title>
    <para><ulink url="http://www.xonotic.org/">Xonotic</ulink> is a free first-person shooter game
      for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The Xonotic project started as a fork of Nexuiz, a game which
      was popular for many years on Linux. The fork was created because Nexuiz was licensed to
      IllFonic game studios, and it is to be used as a platform for developing a commercial game for
      Steam, Xbox and PlayStation.</para>

    <para>Xonotic uses the Darkplaces game engine, an engine which started as a Quake modification,
      but it was under heavy development and new improvements were made. Currently the developers of
      Xonotic state that the game is “on the par with most commercial games from 2006-2007″. Which,
      for the Linux platform is pretty important. (...)</para>

        Trine 2 coming for Linux?</ulink></title>
    <para>I’ve just noticed that <ulink url="http://frozenbyte.com/">Frozenbyte</ulink> is already
      doing the beta for <ulink url="http://www.trine2.com">Trine 2</ulink>, a fun platform game.
      The fun thing is that according to several sources on their forums they are planing to launch
      Trine 2 for Linux alongside with the Windows version or “shortly after”. I never heard of this
      game before and the video makes me remember of a very old DOS game called Goblins III. Either
      way the video is awesome and I’m pretty sure this is a potential purchase for my game
      collection.</para>

      </title>
      <para>Welcome to the Qtest Mobile App Port! As developers of applications using Qt, you
        already know how great it is to work with - but how about on mobile platforms, such as
        Symbian and MeeGo? How would you like to take that step you have been wanting to take, but
        not been able to justify: Take your application from the desktop and bring it into the
        hand-held world via the Ovi store. Let this contest be the justification, with the
        possibility of a new phone or even 10,000 euros waiting at the end. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Dates</emphasis>: The contest starts on 20th of December, 2010,
        and runs till 28th of February. The 31st of December is important for you if you wish to
        take part in the Early Bird competition. If you do no win, you will still take part in the
        main competition, and will be allowed to continue your work and submit new versions to the
        Ovi Store. The 28th of February is the deadline for taking part in the main
        competition.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Developer Sprint</emphasis>: There will be a sponsored developer
        sprint organized together with the KDE e.V. during the competition. The travel and stay can
        be paid for if you do not have the budget yourself. Further details will be made public at a
        later time, and all participants will be notified of this information via email. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Judging and prizes</emphasis>: The Qtest Mobile App Port is
        evaluated by a panel of judges which will be announced in the next few days. The jury will
        pic 5 winners at 31th of December as the early bird winners. Every winner gets a free N900
        phone. The main competition first prize is EUR 10,000, which will be awarded to the
        application which the judges find to be the best ported application. The second to sixth
        price will be another 5 N900 phones.</para>

      <para>And, finally: Everybody who takes part in the competition will be awarded a gift bag,
        with a T-shirt and other merchandise.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Eligibility</emphasis>: To be able to take part in the contest,
        the ported application must be submitted for Ovi Store signing by one of the two deadlines:
        - Early bird entries must be submitted by December 31st - Standard entries must be submitted
        by February 28th.</para>
      <para>You also have to submit your application to the &quot;Mobile Contest&quot; category on
        Qt-Apps.org or MeeGo-Central.org </para>
      <para>You can submit your application to the Ovi Store as many times as you wish during the
        competition. This allows you to get feedback from the public on your software. It´s possible
        to submit new or existing KDE/Qt applications.</para>
      <para>So have fun and good luck everybody!</para>

          >OSTatic/Lisa Hoover: Black Duck Software Buys Olliance Consulting Group</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>In its continued march across the open source industry landscape, <ulink
          url="http://www.blackducksoftware.com">Black Duck Software</ulink>, a Boston-based company
        which services managed and secure implementations of open source software, announced today
        the purchase of <ulink url="http://www.olliancegroup.com/">Olliance Group</ulink>, an open
        source enterprise consulting firm. After <ulink
          url="http://ostatic.com/blog/black-duck-buys-koders">acquiring open source search engine
          Koders</ulink> in 2008, Black Duck got quiet for a while then slurped up three more
        companies in the last three months -- <ulink url="http://www.ohloh.net/">Oholoh</ulink>,
          <ulink
          url="http://ostatic.com/blog/black-duck-extends-its-string-of-open-source-acquisitions"
          >SpikeSource</ulink>, and now Olliance. We caught up wtih Peter Vescuso, Executive Vice
        President of Black Duck Software to find out more about this acquisition and what the future
        holds for the company.</para>
      <para>According to Vescuso, the decision to purchase Olliance was a natural evolution in
        response to the changing needs of Black Ducks' customer base. <quote>Over the last few years
          as our business has grown we’ve encountered more and more customers that not only needed a
          software platform to manage their use of open source components, but wanted help with
          business strategy around their use of open source, policy development, etc. Last year we
          formalized a partnership with Olliance to address this need which has been successful
          beyond our expectations. So much so that we realized for Black Duck to achieve its vision
          of being the company that organizations trust for all their FOSS-enablement needs, we
          needed to acquire Olliance, the leading consultancy in this area</quote>, says
        Vescuso.</para>
      <para>Although Black Duck already offers some consulting services to clients, they are mainly
        focused on pre- and post-deployment support. Olliance's consulting services, on the other
        hand, help businesses map out how open source fits into a their overall business strategy
          <quote>Black Duck’s services have been mostly focused on process integration and
          implementation, roll out, with some services for policy development</quote>, says Vescuso.
          <quote>Olliance’s strength and deep knowledge developed over hundreds of customer
          engagements is in business strategy, policy and process, which is highly complementary to
          what we were offering, hence the motivation to acquire Olliance</quote>. (...) <emphasis

    <para>Late last Monday night, Linus Torvalds marked the sixth release candidate of Linux 3.1 on
      GitHub; however, due to emailing problems, the <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1191106">announcement</ulink> of RC6 only
      reached the LKML on Wednesday. In his announcement, Torvalds said that the RC only contains
      just over one hundred commits, and that things have been fairly quiet. This relative quiet is
      probably a side effect of the <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Security-breach-at-kernel-org-1334642.html">break-in at kernel.org</ulink> and the resulting maintenance work, which has meant that the kernel
      developers have had to <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-x32-ABI-gets-around-64-bit-drawbacks-1342061.html">adapt their work methods</ulink>.</para>
    <para>The Kernel Log will take the Linux 3.1 development progress as an opportunity to continue
      its &quot;Coming in 3.1&quot; mini series with a discussion of the advancements in the kernel&apos;s
      architecture, infrastructure and virtualisation areas. Part 1 of the mini series provided an
      overview of the changes in terms of <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-1-Networking-1323463.html">network drivers and infrastructure</ulink>, while part 2 discussed the kernel&apos;s <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-2-Storage-and-filesystems-1338160.html">storage code and filesystems</ulink>. The series will be concluded with a forthcoming
      article on drivers. (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Linux 3.1 comes with all the components that are required for using the 3D acceleration features of various current GeForce graphics chips. The Intel graphics driver is still not using an important power saving mechanism by default. The kernel now supports the Creative Titanium HD.</emphasis></para>
    <para>In the early hours of Thursday morning, Linus Torvalds released the seventh release
      candidate of Linux 3.1. In the <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1193980">release-mail for RC7</ulink> and in a <ulink url="https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/RDMrsVFQMLu">Google+ post</ulink>
      he says that he is starting to get ready to release 3.1; however, as he explains, it would not
      be practical to have the merge window for Linux 3.2 (which follows the release of 3.1) without
      kernel.org – the servers have not been reachable for two weeks now, while they are being
      reinstalled or checked after the <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Security-breach-at-kernel-org-1334642.html">recent break-in</ulink>. Torvalds also mentioned that he&apos;ll be on vacation in early October and
      indicated that he would not release 3.1 before he comes back. That, according to Torvalds,
      would result in the merge window overlapping with this year&apos;s <ulink url="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-kernel-summit">Kernel Summit</ulink>,
      which takes place from 23 to 25 October. A release of Linux 3.1 before 9 October is therefore
      highly unlikely at this point.</para>
    <para>Due to the approaching finalisation of the new version, the Kernel Log will complete its
      &quot;Coming in 3.1&quot; mini series with a discussion of the Linux kernel&apos;s hardware support
      improvements. Part 1 of the mini series provided an overview of the changes related to <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-1-Networking-1323463.html">network drivers and infrastructure</ulink>, while part 2 discussed the kernel&apos;s <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-2-Storage-and-filesystems-1338160.html">storage code and filesystems</ulink> and part 3 its <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-3-Architecture-infrastructure-virtualisation-1345178.html">architecture, infrastructure and virtualisation</ulink>.</para>

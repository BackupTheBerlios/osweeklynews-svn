    </title>
    <para>With the long summer nights ahead I’ve decided to enable my subscription of World of
      Warcraft and update it to Cataclysm. World of Warcraft classic was awesome, and I’ve seen my
      best days as a player during The Burning Crusade… the Wrath of the Lich Kingýexpansionýsucked
      and I like to dub it as a ‘beggarsýexpansion’… where casuals could have some fancy epic gear
      even without knowing how to play!</para>
    <para>The first requirement for World of Warcraft under Linux is wine… This is one of the best
      things in openSUSE, the wine builds done by Marcus Meissner which live under the <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine/openSUSE_11.4/">Emulators:Wine</ulink> repository. To install this repository in openSUSE 11.4, the easy way:<orderedlist>

          <para>Install the Repository and change it’s priority (we want to have this with higher
            priority than openSUSE normal repositories (default is 99 for openSUSE repositories, and
            the lower the number the higher the priority is):
            <programlisting>zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine/openSUSE_11.4/ Wine

zypper mr -p 75 -r Wine</programlisting></para>

          <para>I had World of Warcraft installed on a windows partition on my PC hard-drive, and
            since I don’t really care to download the awesome 21GB’s again, I’ve decided to use that
            installation. At first I had my drive auto-mounted through fstab, which generated a few
            issues (login always failed). As explained <emphasis role="bold">here</emphasis>, I’ve
            made the necessary changes mounting the drive and now it works fine.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Running through wine (I’ve made a small shell script for this). It is imperative
            that we run the game with the <emphasis role="bold">-opengl</emphasis> switch :
            <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

WoW_INSTALL="/mnt/windows/World of Warcraft/"
BINARY="Wow.exe"
ARGS="-opengl"

    <para>The game runs fine, the biggest improvement I saw was the drop of latency values, from
      130/140 in Windows to 66/70 in Linux, while the FPS values are pretty much the same.
      Everything works and I look forward to level this char fast enough to see some cool 25 men
      Raids in Linux!</para>

          <para>Wine is a free and open-source software that lets users run various kinds of Windows
            applications on Unix-like operating systems. Many users, including some developers often
            mistake Wine for an emulator. That however, is a longstanding myth within the software
            community. In fact, Wine stands for 'Wine is not an emulator', thus repudiating any such
            hollow accusations from the skeptics. </para>
          <para>With Wine, users can run all kinds of games including the latest 3D ones without any
            significant drop in performance. Popular Windows games that run flawlessly on Linux
            using Wine include blockbuster titles like Final Fantasy XI Online, Guild Wars, Fallout
            3.x, Left 4 Dead, Starcraft II and more. You may also see this list: <ulink

              Windows Games That Can Be Played on Linux</ulink></para>
          <para>Apart from running games, Wine can run various types of applications that are
            available only on Windows platforms. Users can also install popular proprietary software
            like Adobe Photoshop, iTunes and Steam. </para>
          <para>Wine is a project which began its journey in 1993 and since then, it has been hugely
            popular with the Linux community. According to a survey, there are about 1.5 million
            currently using Wine. Having said that, Wine suffers from a lot of shortcomings, but
            thanks to the hard work of the developers they are being overcome one by one. Installing
            Wine and playing Games: To install Wine, all you have to do is go to your package
            manager (eg: Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic etc.) and search for 'wine'. Once you
            install wine, installing games isn't much of a problem. Just insert the game CD/DVD and
            click on 'setup.exe'. If the game is perfectly compatible (you may cross check with
              <ulink url="http://appdb.winehq.org/index.php">Wine DB</ulink> first), then the rest
            of the process is exactly the same as on Windows. </para>

          <para>PlayonLinux is a graphical front-end for Wine, which aims at simplifying the
            installation of Windows-based games and applications on Linux. PlayonLinux includes a
            database of most of the popular Windows applications out there. Whenever you search for
            particular software, let's say Left 4 Dead, PlayonLinux will automatically download the
            appropriate Wine version that works best with the game. What's more, it will also
            install any additional software that's needed for the game or application to work
            properly. The database is constantly updated and it even includes some of the latest
            games like Portal 2. Despite the gaming-oriented name of the project, PlayonLinux also
            helps users install applications like IE 6, Firefox (Windows version), <ulink

            also created a Mac counterpart of the software and is titled PlayonMac.</para>
          <para>Installing PlayonLinux: Installing PlayonLinux is very simple. Just go to the <ulink

          <para>Crossover Games is part of the Crossover suite of mixed-source applications that
            enable Linux and Mac users to install and use Windows-based applications. The suite,
            developed by Codeweavers, consists of modified, proprietary versions of the
            aforementioned Wine. Apart from acting as a user-friendly front-end to Wine, Crossover
            Games incorporates various patches and user-friendly configuration tools that makes it
            appealing to Windows migrants. The suite claims to fully support games like
            Counter-Strike, Half-Life 2, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty 2, Guild Wars and more. The
            most impressive thing about this software is that it provides professional support to
            its users. </para>
          <para>Installing/Buying Crossover Games: Crossover Games is already available in the
            Ubuntu Software Center as a trial version. You can download the trial version, install
            an application of your choice and then register (buy) the suite online. To download,
            just go to Ubuntu Software Center and click on the 'For Purchase' tab. Finally, if your
            inner Stallman doesn't slap your wrist every time you buy proprietary software, the
            official website can be found <ulink

    <para>BleachBit quickly frees disk space and tirelessly guards your privacy. Free cache, delete
      cookies, clear Internet history, shred temporary files, delete logs, and discard junk you
      didn't know was there. Designed for Linux and Windows systems, it wipes clean 90 applications
      including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari,andý<ulink
        url="http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/features">more</ulink>. Beyond simply deleting files,
      BleachBit includes advanced features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free
      disk space to hide traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox to
      make it faster. Better than free, BleachBit is open source.</para>

        <para>Some instabilities could happen. In case of crash like no keyboard, mouse, and
          blackscreen on reboot. Try to shutdown properly your computer with the shutdown poweroff
          button (or remote ssh). On reboot, just add 3 at the end of grub line to restart in
          console mode. Then with yast or zypper you can always remove the actual version and try
          the previous version available in the repos. </para>

        >working</ulink> on <ulink url="http://cihar.com/software/slovnik/">dictionaries for
        StarDict</ulink> today, I've decided to finally bring them to openSUSE as well.</para>
    <para>First step was to fix my favorite tool to access them - sdcv. The fixed package is now in
      my home project and will be hopefully soon accepted to Education project so that it is more
      visible (see <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/69901">request 69901</ulink>
      if it is already the case).</para>
    <para>When I had the tool working, it was time to package <ulink
        url="http://cihar.com/software/slovnik/">dictionaries</ulink> themselves. It was quite
      simple task and the rpms are available in <ulink
        url="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3ANijel%3Astardict">my home
        project</ulink>.</para>

        >Holger Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.2.4 supports multiple databases and delivers
        webSMBTA</ulink></title>
    <para>If you don’t have a clue what you are reading here, this article is about the<emphasis
        role="bold"> SMB Traffic Analyzer</emphasis> project, check it’s <ulink
        url="http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/">homepage</ulink> for more
      information about it.</para>
    <para>The development team is proud to announce the release of <emphasis role="bold">version
        1.2.4 of SMB Traffic Analyzer</emphasis>. With a much longer development cycle than usual,
      we took the time to do real ground work on<emphasis role="bold"> SMBTA</emphasis>, and
      reworked the whole database handling. As a result, SMBTA will from now on access it’s
      databases via <ulink url="http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/">libDBI</ulink>, a generic database
      layer. Via libDBI, <emphasis role="bold">SMBTA</emphasis> is potientially able to run with
        <emphasis role="bold">sqlite, MySQL, and postgresql</emphasis> as database backend. Since
      both, smbtad and smbtatools have been rewritten to use the libDBI layer, smbtaquery can know
      run completely independent from smbtad, as it uses<emphasis role="bold"> libDBI</emphasis>
      directly to access the database (<emphasis role="bold">bso#8065</emphasis>). We have tried
      hard to crash smbtad in test suites since we made the move to <emphasis role="bold"
        >libDBI</emphasis>, and moved <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">several tens of
          terabyte</emphasis></emphasis> over samba shares without getting smbtad to fall (we are
      currently using<emphasis role="bold"> postgresql</emphasis> as database). We strongly believe,
      since smbtad does not have to function as a network gateway to the database for the clients
      any more, the move to libDBI will make SMB Traffic Analyzer much more stable. SMB Traffic
      Analyzer 1.2.4 provides an upgrade path if the user wants to use the sqlite database that has
      been created with SMBTA version &lt;= 1.2.3.</para>

    <para>Furthermore,<emphasis role="bold"> SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.2.4</emphasis> debuts <emphasis
        role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">Benjamin Brunner’s</emphasis></emphasis> work on
        <emphasis role="bold">webSMBTA</emphasis>, a web
      interface to all functions of the <emphasis role="bold">smbtaquery</emphasis> program. It is a
      modern, rails3 based, intuitive interface, that <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold"
          >reduces</emphasis></emphasis> object selection <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis
          role="bold">to a few mouse clicks</emphasis></emphasis>, and makes running statistic
      functions on the objects a breeze. <emphasis role="bold">webSMBTA</emphasis> automatically
      retrieves all the objects known in your Samba network, and displays them in a way that gives
      an idea of the network structure. Out of these lists, you click the object you want to run a
      function on, and get a descriptive dialog for the function’s options. The output of functions
      is HTML rendered, and attached to the webSMBTA main page. Our ground work on XML in smbtaquery
      finally pays off, as <emphasis role="bold">webSMBTA</emphasis> is consuming <emphasis
        role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">HTML output</emphasis></emphasis> of smbtaquery
      directly. Once a function has been chosen, it can easily be re-run by clicking it’s reload
        button,<emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold"/></emphasis> or removed from the
      page.</para>
    <para>We have added a new chapter for the documentation on <emphasis role="bold"
        >webSMBTA,</emphasis> as well as to the <emphasis role="bold">libDBI</emphasis>
      change.</para>
    <para>All of smbtatools can now use a single configuration file, serving all of them (<emphasis
        role="bold">bso#8097</emphasis>). The “top” function of smbtaquery can now operate
      descending as well as ascending. (<emphasis role="bold">bso#8095</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>You can download <emphasis role="bold">SMB Traffic Analyzer</emphasis> from the <ulink
        url="http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/smb-traffic-analyzer-download/"
        >download page</ulink>. Please be aware that currently binary packages of smbtatools 1.2.4
      do <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> contain the code for webSMBTA, as webSMBTA is in Beta,
      has not yet been employed with Apache, and is not ready for being packaged. Of course, the
      1.2.4 source tarball of smbtatools does contain the webSMBTA sources. Nevertheless, you can
      find a README file in the smbtatools tarball, describing how to run the webinterface by using
      the internal rails webserver. For more information on <emphasis role="bold">SMB Traffic
        Analyzer</emphasis>, check it’s<ulink

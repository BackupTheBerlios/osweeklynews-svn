    <para>Please refer to my <ulink url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680">previous article</ulink> where all the installation procedure is explained. </para>
    <para>At least after a wrong 11.4 version, and a first buggy 11.5 catalyst version, the new one
      is finally build and ready to install from the repo. Like for 11.3 I’ve clean up all previous
      version which are not xpic, so everybody can easily know which drivers he has to install. I’ve
      resigned all rpm with my key. And the tests made show them working. </para>
    <para>Warning </para>
    <para>Some instabilities have been reported. In case of crash like no keyboard, mouse, and
      blackscreen on reboot. Try to shutdown properly your computer with the shutdown poweroff
      button. On reboot, just add 3 at the end of grub line to restart in console mode. Then with
      yast or zypper you can always try the previous version. </para>

    <para>Well, have you? ýNot the satisfying expulsion of excess gas, but the simplest way you can
      materially contribute to openSUSE.</para>
    <para>I was just hanging in the #active channel, watching my KDE chums make their <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA9zaBZysfI">new touchscreen interface</ulink> (video),
      when somebody complained that <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscaf/files/shared-desktop-ontologies/0.7/">shared-desktop-ontologies</ulink> does not yet contain the latest release needed by KDE git
      master. ýAnd instead of updating the package myself, I suggested they just BURP:</para>

    <para>And by doing so we all get the latest versions in the devel project and soon in Tumbleweed
      and openSUSE Factory. ýSo ambassadors, boosters and motivated contributors know how to do that
      right? ýNow you can use this glib little acronym to persuade friends and colleagues to do the
      same.</para>
    <para>Happy BURPing!</para>

    <para>Some people fear it takes too much time to do a SUSE Manger setup just for testing. I
      decided to show the complete workflow just in screenshots to demonstrate it’s easy and will
      not take longer than maybe 20 minutes – most time just waiting. You can download an eval
      version <ulink url="http://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=UU3B3_bJH-Q%7E">here</ulink>.
      You need at least 2GB RAM and 12GB disk space for installation. </para>
    <para>Let’s go. On the bottom right of each screenshot you have a link that points to the next
      screenshot, so you can easily click through a complete installation now. (...)</para>

      What is "systemd". Roughly said, it's a replacement for "sysvinit", the software in linux that manages the booting process. Systemd is supposed to have a lot of advantages over sysvinit, amongst which improved performance and memory management. It's already available for install on openSUSE 11,4, at the moment a lot of work on systemd is being done to make it a default for openSUSE 12.1. The thread has some interesting info.

      I've seen this message before, and currently am seeing it on my laptop, which runs openSUSE Tumbleweed with GNOME 3 Tumbleweed as a desktop. The console is flooded with this message. This thread explains where the message originates and what one can do to stop the phenomenon.

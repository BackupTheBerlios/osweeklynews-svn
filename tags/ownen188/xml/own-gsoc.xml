    <para>Hello, First of all, I'm sorry for the large delay on updating my previous report. </para>
    <para>I've spent most of the time improving the performance of the classes, adding multiple
      profiles support, and on styling the admin, profile and other pages. </para>
    <para>I have also done performance testing, having responses averaging 50ms/request response
      times on a testing server, with 200 concurrent requests. I expect higher performance on a
      deployment configuration. </para>
    <para>on the To Do List is: Creating at least an offline submitting client (either GTK or QT).
      Finishing the administrative pages configurations. Adding authentication on submitting
      profiles.</para>

    <para>This is a summary of the work that I did in the last week.(Week # 10) </para>
    <para>The test no. 256 was modified to add support for memory mapped i/o operations. Thus, now
      in the test the files are created using both direct i/o as well as memory mapped i/o. </para>
    <para>A new test, test no. 257 was added which handles large file creation and modification of

    <para>Both the tests 256 and 257 were modified to handle any snapshot supported generic file

    <para>This week I’ve been working at getting Remember the Milk integration finished. Right now
      Lists can be added to Remember the Milk and I’m in the middle of implementing update/delete
      functionality. </para>
    <para>It has been a hard week as I’ve never had to use a web based API before and the Remember
      the Milk one doesn’t seem like the easiest to get to grips with (its beta form is probably
      indicative of this). The main time consumer now is getting the update/delete functionality
      which isn’t an issue with Remember The Milks API but one of trying to find the right solution
      that is generic enough to be used with other services so I avoid large chunks of code that are
      specific to a single service.</para>
    <para>For the final week I will continue working on integrating Remember the Milk,Google
      Calendar and WebDAV and over the remaining 10 days I will try and get these services fully
      integrated. The final week of GSoC will hopefully be spent on preparing a 1.0 release and any
      code addition will be kept to a minimum (with a hope that there won’t be any outside of
      merging). </para>

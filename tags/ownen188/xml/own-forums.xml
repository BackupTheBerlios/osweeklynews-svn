    </title>
    <para>
      Here's a nice story, motto "Don't blame it all on your operating system". The thread starter reports an issue with downloading packages from the repos, so he cannot update or install anything. Happy ending is included, but in a slightly different way than one would think.

    </title>
    <para>
      A bit curious, this one. The user gets "wrong digest" errors when he tries to perform a "zypper up" on his newly installed openSUSE 11.4. Interesting thread, no true solution or explanation for the issue yet, but a good example of how others try to analyze the problem and help looking for a way out.

    </title>
    <para>
      It's been quite quiet on this front for a while, it even looked like Adobe was dropping 64bit support for linux anyway, but here's a thread about the release of a beta version of Flashplayer 11 in a 64bit version. For those interested in this matter, read it, share your own experiences.

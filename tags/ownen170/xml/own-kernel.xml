      2.6.39</ulink></title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Torvalds said that he considers 2.6.39 more of a solid version with
        a boring amount of progress – however, with ipset, the Xen network backend, as well as many
        new and improved drivers, the new kernel, which is expected to be released in late May or
        early June, does offer numerous improvements which matter to end users.</emphasis></para>

        >releasing Linux 2.6.38</ulink>, Linus Torvalds has closed the merge window of Linux 2.6.39,
      and completed the integration of this version's major changes, by <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1119897">issuing 2.6.39-rc1</ulink>. At the
      end of his release email, Torvalds said <emphasis role="italic"><quote>But on the whole I
          think this should be one of those 'solid, boring progress' releases.</quote></emphasis>;
      however, his enthusiasm about the auto-grouping of processes and the VFS optimisations in
      2.6.38 had been unusually strong.</para>

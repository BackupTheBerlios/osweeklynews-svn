        >Kartik Mandaville: Karma Plugin for openSUSEConnect</ulink></title>
    <para>This post is about an idea for GSoC 2011 regarding openSUSE Connect.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Short Description</emphasis> : Karma concept in openSUSE Connect
      that will collect points from wiki edits, bugzilla entries, planet.opensuse.org posts,
      distribution changelogs etc and use them in the Connect. Based on Karma, different badges to
      be given. Different categories â€“ developer karma/marketing karma etc. Also, an option to
      reward/ transfer Karma points to another user in recognition of his work. API to be
      implemented to access/ modify Karma points.</para>
    <para>For those of you who have time to read the long description :</para>
    <para>So basic idea of this project is to create different kinds of karma and collect as many
      information as possible automatically. So we will have wiki karma that will grow with every
      wiki page edit. We will have marketing karma growing bigger with every tweet and blog post.
      Packager karma getting bigger with every change submitted to the openSUSE. So this project
      will be not only about displaying and managing karma points but also about collecting
      statistics from various different services. (...)</para>

    <para>A question that has bugged me for some time, is <emphasis role="bold"><quote>how we can
          bring our creations into the hands of more users</quote></emphasis>, and how we can show
      the world that a truely open and community developed system can bring great value to more
      people. How can we overcome the technical barriers that hold back so many people from
      benefitting from our hard work, all the genius, love and creativity we put into software.
      Since my first contact with Free software, Linux openSUSE and KDE, we have done some very
      solid work. We have technically caught up with Microsoft, and are delivering a product that is
      up to par in many aspects, and better in many more ways. While we have booked immense
      successes, we have not reached the goal of making the Linux desktop ubiquitous in the desktop
      market. In a world of iPhones and Android, we even see closed development models based on
      similar technology as ours being a big success, market-wise, but failing to deliver the full
      Freedom of a community-driven development model to end users. (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">One of the new features the recent major release of openSUSE brought
        with it that *really* caught my attention is the ability to turn the distribution into a
        rolling one, effectively bringing it to the camp of the likes of Gentoo and Arch. As a
        former long time user of Gentoo I thought I’d install openSUSE and take it for a drive – but
        most importantly add the Tumbleweed repo to it and see what happens from
      there.</emphasis></para>
    <para><ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</ulink> is the name of the
      repository that once added to your openSUSE installation allows the whole system to be
      regularly upgraded to the latest and greatest software, without the need of ever upgrading the
      OS to a newer, major version of the distribution. The good news is that <quote>latest and
        greatest</quote> doesn’t mean <quote>bleeding edge</quote>. That may be the case with the
      openSUSE Factory repo, but not with Tumbleweed. The bad news is that by turning openSUSE into
      a rolling distro you’ll find yourself re-compiling and re-installing any closed-source drivers
      you rely on more often than you’re probably used to – and in most cases that entails some
      extra labor. But that couldn’t possibly stop me from trying Tumbleweed, so I set off to a
      quest for transforming a local openSUSE 11.4 VMware VM (GNOME edition) into an installation of
      a rolling distribution. Well, it very soon turned out that I was in for a pretty short yet
      quite enjoyable quest. Before I go any further, I should point out that I’m no openSUSE
      expert. I have used the distribution in the past but it never really won me. Despite that, I
      always enjoy trying out new operating systems in general and Linux distributions in particular
      – especially when there’s a new version of a popular brand out. I should probably mention here
      that this time around openSUSE left me with an excellent impression and that’s mainly because
      of zypper, the distribution’s command-line tool for package management. (...)</para>

        Versionitis</ulink></title>
    <para>The voting on how to do the versioning is over and the <quote>old school</quote> has won
      by 55 per cent (of 98 participants). Thanks to all that participated in the two votes and the
      discussion around the topic.</para>
    <para>As Coolo said in on the <ulink
        url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-03/msg00516.html">project list</ulink>,
      we’d like to make a small change to the numbering:</para>
    <para>We will not have a .0 release but only .1, .2, .3 release. Since we have releases in three
      months, the November</para>
    <para> release is always the .1 release, the July release the .2 and the March release the
      .3.</para>
    <para>So, the plan is that the next release will be called openSUSE 12.1 and launched on the
      10th of November, 2011! Two years later – on the 14th of November, 2013 – we will then have
      the openSUSE 13.1 release.</para>
    <para>So, the next four releases are called:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> November 2011: openSUSE 12.1</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> July 2012: openSUSE 12.2</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> March 2013: openSUSE 12.3</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> November 2013: openSUSE 13.1</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Detailed results for logged-in openSUSE members are available at the <ulink
        url="https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/a_jaeger/12979/opensuse-release-versioning"
        >connect poll page</ulink> and I have reproduced them here as well:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A: “old school”: Like currently but only counting the right number until 3:</para>
        <para> 55% (54 votes)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>B: “Fedora style”: Just integers:</para>
        <para> 29 % (28 votes)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>C: “Ubuntu style”: YY.MM:</para>
        <para> 16 % (16 votes)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>This is also consistent with the <ulink
        url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/28/opensuse-release-versioning-poll-on-last-three-options/"
        >results of the first public voting</ulink>.</para>
    <para>Note that openSUSE does not have a major and minor numbering, even if it seems so. There
      is right now no difference in any way between what we would do for openSUSE 11.4 or 12.0 or
      12.1 – and no sense to speak about openSUSE 11 or openSUSE 11 family. We also had in the past
      no process on how to name the next release (when to increase which parts of the
      number).</para>
    <para>I think this new versioning is still consistent with the old one but also an improvement
      since it’s now clear that we change the first digit every two year. The first poll showed that
      half of our users prefer a date based versioning and the other a consecutive numbering. So,
      depending on your point of view, you can see this as a mixture of both or as consecutive
      numbering <inlinemediaobject>

    <para>So, time now to make openSUSE 12.1 a great release!</para>

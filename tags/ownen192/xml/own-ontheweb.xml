      </title>
      <para>As the title says, I just added support for Google Tasks by creating the Akonadi Google
        Tasks Resource. The Tasks API provided by Google is really simple and does not support many
        properties, only name, summary, due to date, completed date and status. You can’t set
        progress percentage, start date, attendees nor reminders (this sucks!). Despite the fact,
        that the API provides means for tree-like structure of tasks (tasks and subtasks), it does
        not seem to work. So you can only have a linear list of tasks. A positive thing is, that due
        to this limited functionality of Google Tasks the resource has a full support of this
        API.</para>
      <para>The reason for independent resource is that you can have multiple task lists in Google
        Calendar, thus merging this functionality into Google Calendar Resource is not an option.
        Unfortunately, you will now have the tasks resources displayed in the list of calendar
        resources in KOrganizer. (...)</para>

      <para>On 21 July, <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-0-1279552.html">Linux kernel 3.0</ulink> was released by Linus Torvalds, bringing some new features such as
        Btrfs data scrubbing and automatic defragmentation, Microsoft Kinect and Apple iSight webcam
        support, AMD&apos;s Llano Fusion APUs support, wake on WLAN, XEN Dom0 support and many new
        drivers which allow Linux to work with a host of new hardware components.</para>

      <para>Michael Meeks, a <ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</ulink> developer
        at Novell, compared the codebase of LibreOffice with the <ulink url="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/">OpenOffice.org</ulink> sources hosted at
        the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). As he writes in a <ulink url="http://people.gnome.org/%7Emichael/blog/2011-09-06.html">blog post</ulink>, the
        differences are already so great that it will now be hard to exchange new code between the
        two projects. In light of the several million lines of source code by which the two products
        now differ, he says users should not assume that code committed to Apache OpenOffice.org
        will &quot;inevitably and automatically appear in LibreOffice&quot;. &quot;Instead I suspect we will end up
        cherry-picking and porting only those things that justify the effort, as/when/if there is
        any such thing,&quot; added Meeks. (...)</para>

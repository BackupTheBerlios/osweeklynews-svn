1.) What are this project?
==========================
This is a project who supports the Code for the openSUSE Weely News.
We are working with XML (DocBook) Files, and using FOP for formatting and
exporting into different Outputformats.
The great plus for this way is that we writing one File, and can
get Outputs for HTML, PDF and others.

2.) Which are the prequisites for me as reader?
===============================================
It is not bad to have a little basic knowledge of XML Files. If not, its
no a tragedy. Because we can use XML Editors, that simplifys the handling
of the XML Files. But keep in mind: What you see in the Editors is partly
not really what we get. We have a special formatting Process, that uses 
own Stylesheets.

3.) What needs my PC for working in this Project?
=================================================
We now list a short List for important Sources.

External:
* Serna free (http://www.syntext.com/downloads/serna/)
* XML Mind (http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/)

Internal (from OBS):
* susedoc
* susedoc-buildbook
* docbook
* fop
Normal if you choose that packages, the Packagemanager will add new Packages
to the List. Thats ok. All of this Packages are needed.

4.) What is the Projects Workaround?
====================================
If you have your BerliOS Account (as written in README), you can go to the Site:
http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=12095 and checkout the Source via
the described "Developer SVN Access". 
The structure of the Repository is written in the README. 

In the following lines i write from a view of a Editor in "trunk/en".
All files to edit are placed in "trunk/en/xml". The whole Weekly News are
splitted into sections. So the Section "Status Updates" are in the File
"own-status-updates.xml". 

In the case that you are need to edit this File, you can open it with one
of the proposed XML Editors. Both, Serna free and XML Mind have plusses and
minusses. If you want to create one or more paragraphs, or you want to move
Paragraphs, then Serna is a good choice. If you want just to write things,
i propose XML Mind. But you have to test both and make experiences, than
you know, what you like. 

There you see the Documentstructure. In "Build Service Team" you see,
that the Article is marked as "blockquote".

The ulink Contains in the first Line the URL. Under that Line we can write
the Summary of the Link. Under blockquote we can see "para". That stands
for Paragraph. There you can place the paragraphs.

If you like to create a list (maybe if you are the Eventeditor), you 
can go to the begin of the document. There i've created a Part
called "itemizedlist". Under that i created a title "Important Links".
Then the FO Processor knows, that he should create a list.
Every point in the List is called as "listitem". Under listitem you
can create ulinks for URL.

So our Eventeditor just must use Itemizedlist and listitem. Other
Fields of the Newsletter needs blockquote and para.

If we have finished editing of one of the own-* Files, we have to 
checkin our stuff to the SVN. So others can use your copy. For checkin use:

$ svn ci

Then svn gives you a Overview about the changes. Now you have to review it and
if its okay, drop a short note about the changes, and close the editor.
Then BerliOS asks for the Password. After passing this, the changes go up
to the SVN.

Please keep in mind, that you have to make a

$ svn up

so often, as possible. Then we have'nt korruptions.

If all Sections are ready, then starts the proofreaders work. The proofreader
can open the file "trunk/en/xml/OWN.xml". If the XML Editor reads this in, all 
subfiles who starts with "own-*" are readed in and included into it. So
the proofreader can see all Documents in one view.

The Editor in chief makes the finishing. We don't delete any sections or paragraphs.
If a paragraph in a section is not needed, we comment it out via:

<!-- View out -->

Maybe we have a whole section who is unneeded, we open OWN.xml just in a editor like vim.
Now i write about the cause, that we don't need own-statusupdates.xml. Then we search
in the OWN.xml the line: 

:include href="own-status-updates.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

and we comment it out like:

<!--
<xi:include href="own-status-updates.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
-->

Then the Processor outcluded it.

Now follows the next Document "BUILD".

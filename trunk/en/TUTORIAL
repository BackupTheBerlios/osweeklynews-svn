Find the XML sources in trunk/en/xml.

Edit the XML files with a XML editor. I use 2 different
editors, because both has pros and cons:

 * Serna free (http://www.syntext.com/downloads/serna/)
 * XML Mind (http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/)

You can download both for free.

As each sections are splitted in separate XML files, all XML files
can be opened in a tab.

So i invite you for a crash course. Please open own-status-updates.xml
with your preffered editor. In my case i'm using atm XML-Mind.
If you go to View (after search in the Menubar). Then choose
"No Stylesheet". There you see the Documentstructure.
In "Build Service Team" you see, that the Article is marked as "blockquote".
The ulink Contains in the first Line the URL. Under that Line we can write
the Summary of the Link. Under blockquote we can see "para". That stands
for Paragraph. There you can place the paragraphs.

If you like to create a list, you can go to the begin of the document.
There you read Statusupdates/Distribution. There i've created a Part
called "itemizedlist". Under that i created a title "Important Links".
Then the FO Processor knows, that he should create a list.
Every point in the List is called as "listitem". Under listitem you
can create ulinks for URL.

For special questions you can ask: saigkill@opensuse.org or
toms@suse.de (our Docbook Consultant).

If all Subcorners are ready, then starts the proofreading process.
For that the proofreader can use the OWN.xml. That file is the
Root-File for the whole subcontent. in that file the proofreader can
see all subcontents in one view.

If all is ready the next Step comes.

This README file explains how to build the openSUSE
Weekly News (OWN).

Some things has changed since the last Wiki Issues.

The structure of the SVN repository looks like this:

* branches/
* tags/     Contain the snapshots for each edition
* trunk/    Your working directory
    en/     All stuff for the English newsletter
            Other languages can be added, if needed
     .      README, Makefiles
     logos/ This folder contains pictures)
     xml/   Contains the XML sources
     xslt/  Contains no editable content, only stylesheets
        fo/  Stylesheets for the FO output

If you would like to add a language folder, send a mail
to: saigkill@opensuse.org

Before you start editing, make a "svn up", to get the lastest files.
If you haven't an user account on BerliOS, register there:
  http://developer.berlios.de/account/register.php
After registering, please send your user account to saigkill@opensue.org,
to get commit access for our SVN repository.

First Step (Editing)
====================

Find the XML sources in trunk/en/xml.

Edit the XML files with a XML editor. I use 2 different
editors, because both has pros and cons:

 * Serna free (http://www.syntext.com/downloads/serna/)
 * XML Mind (http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/)

You can download both for free.

As each sections are splitted in separate XML files, all XML files
can be opened in a tab.

So i invite you for a crash course. Please open own-status-updates.xml
with your preffered editor. In my case i'm using atm XML-Mind.
If you go to View (after search in the Menubar). Then choose
"No Stylesheet". There you see the Documentstructure.
In "Build Service Team" you see, that the Article is marked as "blockquote".
The ulink Contains in the first Line the URL. Under that Line we can write
the Summary of the Link. Under blockquote we can see "para". That stands
for Paragraph. There you can place the paragraphs.

If you like to create a list, you can go to the begin of the document.
There you read Statusupdates/Distribution. There i've created a Part
called "itemizedlist". Under that i created a title "Important Links".
Then the FO Processor knows, that he should create a list.
Every point in the List is called as "listitem". Under listitem you
can create ulinks for URL.

For special questions you can ask: saigkill@opensuse.org or
toms@suse.de (our Docbook Consultant).

If all Subcorners are ready, then starts the proofreading process.
For that the proofreader can use the OWN.xml. That file is the
Root-File for the whole subcontent. in that file the proofreader can
see all subcontents in one view.

If all is ready the next Step comes.

Second Step (Formatting and PDF Processing)
===========================================

For this step we need two special package from the Build Service.
You need the packages "susedoc" & "susedoc-buildbook". Both packages
have depencies to other needed packages like fop. That's ok. We
need all of this.

Then we have prepared a Script for exporting XML to PDF through FO.
Just run "xml2pdf.sh" in the shell. The next steps should run
automaticly through the Script. The result is a PDF File called OWN.pdf.

That file you can distribute on every place.

Third Step (Next Issue)
=======================

For the next issue we use the same files. But we have to be careful.
We can overwrite the old Content, but now we place on the last edited
part the string "EDITMARK". Then the next Editor knows, that he can
go forward under this mark in the next para.

TODO every issue
================

After the issue is published, we go to xml/entities.ent and replace
the old issuenumber with the new.
If we would like to place a Editors Note, just go to xml/OWN.xml.
Under the Authorlist  we have a range called <abstract><para> There
we can make a Editors Note.

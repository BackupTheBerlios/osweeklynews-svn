As you maybe know, this is a SVN Repository. There you find all 
needed Stuff for building the new Weekly News.

Some things has changed since the last Wiki Issues. Sadly for me 
was the Workload very full. After the Proofreadingsession with Satoru 
i have copied the whole wiki content and pasted it to google docs.
Then in google docs must fix any things so that the Output goes to HTML.
That Code i must copy and paste it into news.opensuse.org

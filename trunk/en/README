As you maybe know, this is a SVN Repository. There you find all 
needed Stuff for building the new Weekly News.

Some things has changed since the last Wiki Issues.

We have now the following Repositorycontent:

branches/
tags/
trunk/ (This is the place for working)
    en/ (All stuff for the english newsletter)
        We can add everytime a new folder for other Languages.
     .  README, Makefiles
     logos/ (This folder contains pictures)
     xml/   (That folder contains the to editing content)
     xslt/  (This folder contains no editable content. Just
             Stylesheets.)
        fo/  (Stylesheets).
        
If you would like to add a Languagefolder so just send a mail
to: saigkill@opensuse.org

Before you start editing, please make a "svn up", so you get
the last recent files.
If you haven't an Useraccount by Berlios, you can register there:

After registering, please send your Username to saigkill@opensue.org,
then you get commit access to our SVN Repository.

First Step (Editing)
====================

Your needed stuff is located in trunk/en/xml.

To edit this XML Files you need a XML Editor. I'm using 2 different
Editors, because both has plusses and minus. The both i propose are:
* Serna free (http://www.syntext.com/downloads/serna/)
* XML Mind (http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/)
You can download it for free.

In my case i have all xml files in my editor open in a tab. The new
thing now is, that all Sections are splitted in a own XML-File. So you
can open all files you need in a tab.

So i invite you for a crash course. Please open own-status-updates.xml
with your preffered editor. In my case i'm using atm XML-Mind.
If you go to View (after search in the Menubar). Then choose
"No Stylesheet". There you see the Documentstructure.
In "Build Service Team" you see, that the Article is marked as "blockquote".
The ulink Contains in the first Line the URL. Under that Line we can write
the Summary of the Link. Under blockquote we can see "para". That stands
for Paragraph. There you can place the paragraphs.

If you like to create a list, you can go to the begin of the document. 
There you read Statusupdates/Distribution. There i've created a Part
called "itemizedlist". Under that i created a title "Important Links".
Then the FO Processor knows, that he should create a list. 
Every point in the List is called as "listitem". Under listitem you
can create ulinks for URL.

For special questions you can ask: saigkill@opensuse.org or 
toms@suse.de (our Docbook Consultant).

If all Subcorners are ready, then starts the proofreading process. 
For that the proofreader can use the OWN.xml. That file is the
Root-File for the whole subcontent. in that file the proofreader can
see all subcontents in one view.

If all is ready the next Step comes.

Second Step (Formatting and PDF Processing)
===========================================

For this step we need two special package from the Build Service.
You need the packages "susedoc" & "susedoc-buildbook". Both packages
have depencies to other needed packages like fop. That's ok. We 
need all of this.

Then we have prepared a Script for exporting XML to PDF through FO.
Just run "xml2pdf.sh" in the shell. The next steps should run 
automaticly through the Script. The result is a PDF File called OWN.pdf.

That file you can distribute on every place.

Third Step (Next Issue)
=======================

For the next issue we use the same files. But we have to be careful.
We can overwrite the old Content, but now we place on the last edited
part the string "EDITMARK". Then the next Editor knows, that he can
go forward under this mark in the next para.

TODO every issue
================

After the issue is published, we go to xml/entities.ent and replace
the old issuenumber with the new.
If we would like to place a Editors Note, just go to xml/OWN.xml.
Under the Authorlist  we have a range called <abstract><para> There
we can make a Editors Note.

    <para>Ok, we&apos;re a week away from the kernel summit, and here&apos;s the last -rc
I&apos;m planning to make.</para>
    <para>There really hasn&apos;t been all that much going on - the smallish MIPS
updates are still the bulk of this -rc, and the rest is pretty much
small driver fixes. Oh, and some last-minute fs (btrfs and xfs) fixes
in there too.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is about as informative as it gets. There&apos;s still some
discussion about a couple of minor things we would like to get
resolved, but on the whole 3.1 is long over-due and by the KS I think
everybody will be relieved to have it out, and ready to open the merge
window. (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Linux 3.2 includes support for Hexagon CPUs, enhancements to the TCP

      3.2 have now been merged. Between now and the release of the final version, scheduled for late
      December or early January, the focus for kernel developers will be on bug fixes.</para>

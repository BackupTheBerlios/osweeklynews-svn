    <para>Ok, we&apos;re a week away from the kernel summit, and here&apos;s the last -rc
I&apos;m planning to make.</para>
    <para>There really hasn&apos;t been all that much going on - the smallish MIPS
updates are still the bulk of this -rc, and the rest is pretty much
small driver fixes. Oh, and some last-minute fs (btrfs and xfs) fixes
in there too.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is about as informative as it gets. There&apos;s still some
discussion about a couple of minor things we would like to get
resolved, but on the whole 3.1 is long over-due and by the KS I think
everybody will be relieved to have it out, and ready to open the merge
window. (...)</para>

    </title>
    <para>Linux 3.2-rc2 is out there now. Well, the git trees are there
(kernel.org and github), and the tar-file should be all done, but the
patch is still uploading.</para>
    <para>One thng worth noting: I got the new release scripts right, so now the
-rc2 files are found in their proper location under &quot;v3.x/testing&quot;,
unlike -rc1 that got put directly in &quot;v3.x&quot;. I&apos;ll fix the -rc1
location when I&apos;m somewhere with better network.</para>
    <para>And for being an -rc2 release of a pretty large merge-window, it seems
to be quite reasonably sized. In fact, despite this having been the
largest linux-next in a release in our linux-next history (I think),
rc2 has the exact same number of commits since rc1 as we had during
the 3.1 release.</para>
    <para>About half the changes are architecture fixups (m68k and arm, with
some powerpc and a smattering of others) Of the rest, about half is
drivers (much of it drm), and the rest is &quot;filesystems and sundry
updates&quot;.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is appended for people who enjoy that level of detail. (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">The TCP stack is now faster at adapting the data transmission rate to the available line capacity. The drivers for Wi-Fi components by Atheros and Broadcom have matured considerably; other drivers will support more LAN and Wi-Fi hardware in 3.2 than they did before.</emphasis></para>
    <para>No major changes have been integrated into the main development branch of Linux since the
        <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Linux-3-2-main-development-phase-complete-1375016.html">first release candidate</ulink> of Linuxý3.2 became available, closing this version&apos;s merge
      window. Linus Torvalds will probably soon release the second RC of this kernel version, the
      final release of which is expected to become available in mid to late January; until then,
      Torvalds will mainly incorporate fixes and small, harmless improvements as he has done in the
      past few days.</para>
    <para>The Kernel Log is now in a position to provide a comprehensive overview of the most
      important new features of Linux 3.2. As usual, this information will be presented within the
      &quot;Coming in 3.2&quot; series of articles that will gradually cover the kernel&apos;s various functional
      areas. Partý1 of the series is below and describes the most important changes to the network
      stack, and the related LAN and Wi-Fi hardware drivers. Over the coming weeks, further articles
      will discuss the kernel&apos;s storage support, filesystems, architecture code, infrastructure, and
      other hardware drivers.</para>

    </title>
    <para>and a happy Independence Day to all the US kernel people out there.</para>
    <para>There is not a lot to be said about -rc6. The biggest part by far is
the inclusion of the intel isci driver - I was admittedly a bit
doubtful about it, but it&apos;s not like it is going to cause regressions
for any existing Linux users, so whatever.</para>
    <para>And quite frankly, Christoph Hellwig has now _twice_ said good things
about that driver, which is pretty unusual. It might mean that the
driver is great. Of course, it&apos;s way more likely that space aliens are
secretly testing their happy drugs on Christoph. Or maybe he&apos;s just
naturally mellowing.</para>
    <para>Other than the isci driver, the rest really is just lots of random
small stuff. It&apos;s getting to the point where I&apos;m thinking I should
just release 3.0, because it&apos;s been pretty quiet, and the fixes
haven&apos;t been earth-shakingly exciting. Some drm (radeon and intel)
fixes might be noticeable to more people, the rest would tend to be
pretty esoteric.</para>
    <para>And so, I&apos;m off to make s&apos;mores, (...)</para>

    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Six years later than originally expected, the kernel now contains all the essential components for Xen Dom0 operation. In Linux 3.0, the developers are tackling various problems in the ARM code, reboot code and UEFI code; however, Torvalds has slightly disappointedly given up on the code size optimisations.</emphasis>

</para>
    <para>This has been another week in which Linus Torvalds <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1163430">issued</ulink> a release candidate of Linux 3.0 late on Monday night. In his release email for RC6, Torvalds points out the inclusion of the Intel isci driver (for example 1) for the SAS controller in Intel&apos;s C600 server and workstation chipset, which is due to be released in the coming months. The driver is relatively large. Torvalds was unsure about merging it so late in the development cycle, <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1163430">saying</ulink> that &quot;I was admittedly a bit doubtful about it, but it&apos;s not like it is going to cause regressions for any existing Linux users, so whatever.&quot;</para>
    <para>Apart from the driver, the developers have only made minor corrections in various places. Torvalds indicated that he is getting to the point where he is thinking about releasing Linux 3.0 &quot;because it&apos;s been pretty quiet, and the fixes haven&apos;t been earth-shakingly exciting&quot;. The Kernel Log will, therefore, continue its report on the advancements of Linux 3.0 by discussing the changes to the kernel&apos;s architecture, infrastructure and virtualisation components. In the coming days, the fourth and last part of the &quot;Coming in 3.0&quot; mini series will discuss drivers; <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-0-Part-1-Networking-1257847.html">part 1</ulink> revolved around the kernel&apos;s network drivers and infrastructure, and <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-0-Part-2-Filesystems-1263681.html">part 2</ulink> discussed its filesystems.

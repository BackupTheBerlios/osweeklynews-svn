        3.0-rc2</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>You all know the drill by now: another week, another -rc.  It's been reasonably quiet,
      although the btrfs update is bigger than I was hoping for. Other than that, it's mostly driver
      fixes, some ubifs updates too, and a few reverts for the early regressions.  But -rc2 is
      already small enough that it easily fits as an appended shortlog, and hopefully things will
      stay calm. Of course, part of that may be due to other people also havin been busy traveling,
      so let's see (and hope for the best). And I haven't been super-eager to pull, so there is a
      couple of pending requests still in my mail queue. </para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">A Just-in-Time compiler promises to provide fast network packet
        filtering. The Wi-Fi stack now supports the Wake-on-Wireless-LAN standard, and unprivileged
        users are allowed to "ping". New and improved drivers enhance the kernel's support of
        network components by Ralink and Realtek.</emphasis></para>
    <para>At the beginning of the week, Linus Torvalds <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1150660">issued</ulink> the second release
      candidate of Linux 3.0. After a rather surprising <ulink

        >another</ulink> Linux 3.0.0 release candidate for reasons of compatibility, although the
      eventual kernel is to be called 3.0. In his release email for RC2, Torvalds writes that things
      have been reasonably quiet, although a Btrfs update was bigger than he had hoped; "hopefully
      things will stay calm", he continued.</para>
    <para>As scheduled, most of the changes for the next major kernel revision were incorporated
      into the main development branch of Linux during the merge window. As only corrections and
      minor improvements are likely to be incorporated from now on, the Kernel Log is already in a
      position to provide a comprehensive overview of the most important advancements of Linux 3.0,
      which is expected to be completed near the middle or end of July.</para>
    <para>Several articles in the "Coming in 3.0" series will gradually cover the kernel's various
      functional areas. The first part in this mini series follows below and describes the most
      important changes to the network stack and the drivers that are based on it. Over the coming
      weeks, further articles will discuss the kernel's graphics drivers, storage support, file
      systems, architecture code, infrastructure and other hardware drivers. (...)</para>

  <title>Kernel Review</title>

    </title>
    <para>Nothing terribly exciting here.</para>
    <para>The most noteworthy thing may be that only about a quarter of the
changes are in drivers, filesystem changes actually account for more
(40%): btrfs, cifs, ext4, jbd2, nfs are all present and accounted for.</para>
    <para>On the driver side, there&apos;s some gpu updates, infiniband, mmc, sound
and some SCSI target fixes.</para>
    <para>And the normal random smattering of changes all around. Like some
long-standing compile failure (admittedly you need to enable some
esoteric resource counting options and disable NUMA to trigger it, but
still). I think there&apos;s a few more lurking in staging, with fixes yet
to be merged.</para>
    <para>The appended shortlog is fairly readable. (...)</para>

    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">With the next kernel version, Ext4 will reach new levels of performance and use a trick to increase its storage media formatting speed. Other new features include a discard function that is interesting for slow-trimming SSDs, the "Rados Block Device" for cluster devices, bug fixes and optimisations to Btrfs.  </emphasis></para>
    <para>The Kernel Log takes the recent release of RC4 of kernel version 2.6.37, whose final
      release is expected around the end of the year, as an opportunity to continue its "Coming in
      2.6.37" mini series and describe the file systems improvements. <ulink

        >Part 1 of the series</ulink> described the changes in the graphics hardware area and in the
      coming weeks, further articles will discuss the changes to the kernel's architecture code,
      drivers and surrounding infrastructure. (...) <!-- ($ ld: 10.12.10 sm $) --></para>

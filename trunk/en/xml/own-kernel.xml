    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">2010 was another exciting year for the Linux kernel and its community. Over the course of four kernel releases and many tens of thousands of 
      mailing list messages, over one thousand individual developers (some working alone, some working for corporations) contributed two new architectures, several new file 
      systems, and drivers for key hardware in the form of the Nouveau Nvidia driver (produced independently of Nvidia) and an open source Broadcom driver for its recent Wi-Fi 
      chips. Of course, many more features were added, too… </emphasis></para>
    <para>Along the way, we also had two huge flame wars, several major security holes (one of which had been around for many years) were fixed, and many regressions were tracked 
      and squashed. But if the year had to be summarised in a word, that word would be scalability. 2010 saw work on almost every aspect of the kernel – from Nick Piggin’s VFS 
      (virtual file system) scalability patches to Arnd Bergmann’s BKL (Big Kernel Lock) removal work, and countless other efforts in between. You will see that recurring theme 
      in the following month-by-month summary. If you’d like to see some more figures to accompany this timeline, visit the Linux Foundation website (linuxfoundation.org). Their 
      annual kernel report focuses on overall numbers, not on individual features as we do here.</para>

    <para>Support for fast USB 3.0 storage devices with USB Attached SCSI Protocol (UASP), an audio
      loopback driver plus extensions to support Apple&apos;s Magic Trackpad are only some of the
      advances that improve the hardware support of the forthcoming Linux kernel version 2.6.37;
      final release is expected in January. (...)</para>

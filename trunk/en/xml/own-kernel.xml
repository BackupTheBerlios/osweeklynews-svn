        graphic support</ulink>
    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">For Linux 2.6.38, the kernel developers have integrated the
        much-discussed patch which considerably improves the response time of Linux desktops in
        certain situations. The AMD developers have extended their open source graphics drivers to
        support various Radeon HD 6000 graphics chips. A discussion was sparked by the tricky
        situation surrounding the graphics drivers for Intel's new processors. </emphasis></para>
    <para>After the <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-2-6-37-1163376.html">release
        of Linux 2.6.37</ulink> on Wednesday morning, the first patches for kernel version 2.6.38
      appeared in the Linux main development branch late on Thursday night. Among Torvalds' first
      2,769 commits were the almost 600 patches for the network subsystem that had been <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/183011">submitted</ulink> by its
      maintainer, David Miller. As expected, these patches have added the <ulink

        driver</ulink> for Realtek's RTL8192CE and RTL8188CE 802.11n Wi-Fi chips to the kernel. </para>
    <para>The first changes made for Linux 2.6.38 also include <ulink
        url="http://git.kernel.org/linus/5091faa449ee0b7d73bc296a93bca9540fc51d0a">the patch</ulink>
      that considerably improves the interactivity of desktop applications in situations where the
      CPU is fully utilised. This patch became known through such articles as <ulink
        url="http://bit.ly/fI6LyR"><quote>The ~200 Line Linux Kernel Patch That Does
        Wonders</quote></ulink> on the Phoronix web site; details of the patch's functionality as
      well as a description of an alternative, more flexible, approach can be found in a <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Fast-response-times-via-process-groups-1141390.html"
        >previous Kernel Log</ulink>. The maintainer of the process scheduler, Ingo Molnar, <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1084129">explicitly pointed out</ulink> this
      function in his Git-Pull request, calling it <quote>one of the biggest and most visible
        interactivity improvements achieved by the Linux scheduler</quote>. (...) <emphasis

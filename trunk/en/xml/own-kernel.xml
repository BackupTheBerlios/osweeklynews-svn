    <para>Ok, we&apos;re a week away from the kernel summit, and here&apos;s the last -rc
I&apos;m planning to make.</para>
    <para>There really hasn&apos;t been all that much going on - the smallish MIPS
updates are still the bulk of this -rc, and the rest is pretty much
small driver fixes. Oh, and some last-minute fs (btrfs and xfs) fixes
in there too.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is about as informative as it gets. There&apos;s still some
discussion about a couple of minor things we would like to get
resolved, but on the whole 3.1 is long over-due and by the KS I think
everybody will be relieved to have it out, and ready to open the merge
window. (...)</para>

        >h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: real-time kernel goes Linux 3.0</ulink>
    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The patches for real-time support are now based on a much more
        recent kernel version. Torvalds has revoked a change merged into 3.2 which had come under
        widespread criticism from developers. AMD and Intel have released new graphics
        drivers.</emphasis></para>
    <para>With the release of real-time (RT) kernel <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1214898">3.0.9-rt25</ulink>, Thomas Gleixner
      has declared that the <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-0-1279552.html">Linux
        3.0</ulink>-based RT tree is now ready for use in live systems. He noted that this new
      version series represents a major leap forward and that development has run pretty smoothly,
      despite major revisions to many of the core techniques.</para>
    <para>Gleixner has now handed over responsibility for maintaining RT patches for Linux 3.0 to
      Steven Rostedt, who recently released a <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1217680">pre-release version of Linux
        3.0.9-rt26</ulink> for evaluation. Gleixner has ported the changes aimed at improving
      real-time properties to pre-release versions of Linux 3.2 (<ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/7445">1</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/7462">2</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/7499">3</ulink>). The RT patch has shrunk
      substantially in the process, as some of the changes have now been incorporated into the main
      development tree.</para>

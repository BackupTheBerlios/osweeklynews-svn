    </title>
    <para>and a happy Independence Day to all the US kernel people out there.</para>
    <para>There is not a lot to be said about -rc6. The biggest part by far is
the inclusion of the intel isci driver - I was admittedly a bit
doubtful about it, but it&apos;s not like it is going to cause regressions
for any existing Linux users, so whatever.</para>
    <para>And quite frankly, Christoph Hellwig has now _twice_ said good things
about that driver, which is pretty unusual. It might mean that the
driver is great. Of course, it&apos;s way more likely that space aliens are
secretly testing their happy drugs on Christoph. Or maybe he&apos;s just
naturally mellowing.</para>
    <para>Other than the isci driver, the rest really is just lots of random
small stuff. It&apos;s getting to the point where I&apos;m thinking I should
just release 3.0, because it&apos;s been pretty quiet, and the fixes
haven&apos;t been earth-shakingly exciting. Some drm (radeon and intel)
fixes might be noticeable to more people, the rest would tend to be
pretty esoteric.</para>
    <para>And so, I&apos;m off to make s&apos;mores, (...)</para>

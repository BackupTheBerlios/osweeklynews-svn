    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">In 2.6.39, the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) disappears for good. The kernel
        can now process interrupts, which reduces latency. The Xen code now has a network backend
        needed for Dom0 operation, but it doesn't look like the storage backend will be coming
        anytime soon.</emphasis></para>
    <para>On Wednesday morning, Linus Torvalds <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1135043">released</ulink> the sixth release
      candidate of Linux kernel 2.6.39. It contains several mostly minor changes. Torvalds says
      kernel developers are still looking into a number of problems, so it will not be the last RC,
      and it will probably be more than 10 days before 2.6.39 is released.</para>
    <para>Prompted by the progress in 2.6.39, the Kernel Log is taking this opportunity to continue
      the mini-series <quote>Coming in 2.6.39</quote> with a description of the innovations in the
      kernel's infrastructure and architecture code. The <ulink

        >first part</ulink> dealt with changes to network drivers and infrastructure; <ulink

      next week.</para>

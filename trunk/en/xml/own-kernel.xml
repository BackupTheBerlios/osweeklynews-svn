    <para>"<emphasis role="bold">Kernel version 38 will offer a new meshing implementation, loads of
        new and improved LAN and Wi-Fi drivers, plus various minor changes that promise to improve
        the network subsystem's performance.</emphasis>

    <para>All the parts in this Kernel Log mini-series can be found by referring to <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Linux-Kernel-2-6-38-Tracking-1193254.html">the
        2.6.38 tracking page</ulink>. </para>
    <para>Early on the morning of 22 February, Linus Torvalds <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1103561">issued</ulink> the sixth release
      candidate of Linux 2.6.38. In his release email, Torvalds mentioned a fix for a memory
      corruption problem – but he said that it is rare and only two people ever saw it. There was no
      indication of a final release date for 2.6.38. Usually released on a weekly basis, the
      "regression reports" have recently listed <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.acpi.devel/49465">17 unsolved problems</ulink>
      which don't exist in 2.6.37; a further <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/186887">26 flaws</ulink> introduced between
      2.6.36 and 2.6.37 also remain unsolved. </para>
    <para>The Kernel Log takes the release of RC6 as an opportunity to continue its "Coming in
      2.6.38" mini series and describe the advancements in terms of network hardware drivers and
      infrastructure. <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-1-Graphics-1176900.html"
        >The first part of our mini series</ulink> described the changes in the graphics hardware
      area, while the <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-2-File-systems-1192694.html"
        >second part</ulink> covered file systems. Over the coming weeks, further articles will
      discuss the kernel's storage, architecture and infrastructure code as well as its audio, USB,
      and video hardware drivers. (...)</para>

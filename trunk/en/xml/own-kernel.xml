    <para>Ok, we&apos;re a week away from the kernel summit, and here&apos;s the last -rc
I&apos;m planning to make.</para>
    <para>There really hasn&apos;t been all that much going on - the smallish MIPS
updates are still the bulk of this -rc, and the rest is pretty much
small driver fixes. Oh, and some last-minute fs (btrfs and xfs) fixes
in there too.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is about as informative as it gets. There&apos;s still some
discussion about a couple of minor things we would like to get
resolved, but on the whole 3.1 is long over-due and by the KS I think
everybody will be relieved to have it out, and ready to open the merge
window. (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">A number of changes to Btrfs mean that filesystem structures will not be as prone to corruption in case of system crashes. By bundling blocks into clusters, Ext4 should be a lot faster in some scenarios. CIFS also promises speed gains.</emphasis></para>
    <para>Last week, just in time for the US Thanksgiving holiday, Linus Torvalds <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1220028">released</ulink> the third pre-release version of Linux 3.2. The commits since RC2 have, according to Torvalds, been mostly small and reasonable, though there is &quot;certainly more churn&quot; than he would have liked.</para>
    <para>Torvalds is likely to release the fourth pre-release version at the end of this week or the start of next, with the final release expected in early to mid-January. In light of the ongoing development of Linux 3.2, the Kernel Log is continuing its &quot;Coming in 3.2&quot; series by describing new features in the area of filesystems. The first article in the series looked at changes to <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-2-Part-1-Networking-1379085.html">network drivers and network infrastructure</ulink>; articles on architecture code, infrastructure and drivers for other hardware will follow over the next few weeks.

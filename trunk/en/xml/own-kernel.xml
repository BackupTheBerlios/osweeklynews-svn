        >h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: What's new in Linux 2.6.39</ulink>
    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The latest Linux kernel offers drivers for AMD's current high-end
        graphics chips and ipsets that simplify firewall implementation and maintenance. The Ext4
        file system and the block layer are now said to work faster and offer improved scalability.
        Hundreds of new or improved drivers enhance the kernel's hardware support.</emphasis></para>
    <para>Version 2.6.39 once again took Linus Torvalds and his fellow developers less than 70 days
      to complete. This is further indication of a slight, though ever more apparent, increase in
      the kernel's development speed, as about 80 to 90ýdays still passed between the release of two
      versions one or two years ago. With 2.6.39, this also meant that there was a slight decrease
      in the number of advancements which are worth mentioning in the Kernel Log; however, there are
      still plenty of changes that will make Linux faster and better.</para>
    <para>This article will provide a brief description of the new Linux version's most important
      improvements. Many of these improvements affect not only servers but also notebooks and
      desktop PCs. The distribution kernels will bring the improvements to the majority of Linux
      systems in the short or medium term, as these kernels are based on the kernels released by
      Linus Torvalds. (...)</para>

        Linux 2.6.39 assists firewalls, speeds up Ext4</ulink></title>
    <para>The Linux 2.6.39 kernel was released featuring new IPset technology for simplifying
      firewall deployment. Other major features include Ext4 performance and scalability
      improvements, a media controller subsystem for video acquisition, a block plugging overhaul
      for fast storage I/O, and support for new AMD "Cayman" Radeon graphics.</para>

          >announced the 2.6.39 release</emphasis></ulink> with some doubts as to whether he should
      have issued another RC release instead. A scheduling conflict caused by the fact that the

      push the new kernel out the door without merging more code. The deciding factor, he writes, is
      that this kernel release window has been "fairly 'easy'."</para>
    <para>Linux 2.6.39 is a modest release compared to the mid-March <ulink

          2.6.38</emphasis></ulink>, which featured an overhaul of the Virtual File System and a
      performance enhancing "automatic process grouping" patch, among other improvements. That
      release may have also seen a major power regression leading to higher power consumption,

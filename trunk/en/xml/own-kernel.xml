    <para>"<emphasis role="bold">Linux 2.6.38 contains patches to improve the scalability of VFS
        that have been the topic of much discussion for the past six months and that Torvalds
        himself was waiting for. Ext3 and XFS now support batched discard, which is interesting for
        SSDs, while Btrfs and SquashFS support additional compression technologies.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>All the parts in this Kernel Log mini-series can be found by referring to <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Linux-Kernel-2-6-38-Tracking-1193254.html">the
        2.6.38 tracking page</ulink>. </para>
    <para>On Wednesday, Linus Torvalds released the <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1101172">fifth pre-release of</ulink> kernel
      version 2.6.38 saying that some regressions have been fixed and other changes are "pretty
      spread out and small". The Kernel Log therefore takes the opportunity to continue the overview
      of the major changes in Linux 2.6.38 with the second part of the mini-series "Coming in
      2.6.38". <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-1-Graphics-1176900.html"
        >Part one</ulink> discussed the main changes pertaining to graphics drivers, and in the next
      few weeks we will be discussing network support, storage hardware, drivers, and code for
      architecture and infrastructure." (...)</para>

    <para>[ Heh. Somewhat delayed, but I literally didn&apos;t notice that all my
outgoing email bounced for the last couple of days, so here it is
again. Originally *meant* to be sent on Monday, just apparently never
got anywhere. So when it says &quot;I should have done this yesterday&quot;, it
actually *means* Sunday ;^]</para>
    <para>So I should have done this yesterday, but I was distracted. So here it
is, a day late:</para>
    <para>git://github.com/torvalds/linux.git</para>
    <para>with just over a hundred commits. It&apos;s been fairly quiet.</para>
    <para>Some arm and openrisc updates, various small driver fixes (the drm
nvidia fixes might be the ones most noticeable to people), and some
fuse, 9p and btrfs updates for filesystems.</para>
    <para>Nothing really stands out. Have at it, and let us know of any
outstanding regressions. (...)</para>

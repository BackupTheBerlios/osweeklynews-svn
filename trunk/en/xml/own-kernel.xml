    <para>Ok, we&apos;re a week away from the kernel summit, and here&apos;s the last -rc
I&apos;m planning to make.</para>
    <para>There really hasn&apos;t been all that much going on - the smallish MIPS
updates are still the bulk of this -rc, and the rest is pretty much
small driver fixes. Oh, and some last-minute fs (btrfs and xfs) fixes
in there too.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is about as informative as it gets. There&apos;s still some
discussion about a couple of minor things we would like to get
resolved, but on the whole 3.1 is long over-due and by the KS I think
everybody will be relieved to have it out, and ready to open the merge
window. (...)</para>

    <para>So it&apos;s been two weeks since 3.1, and you know how it works by now.</para>
    <para>I have to say, this wasn&apos;t my favorite merge window ever. I really
wanted to take only things that had been in -next, but verifying it
was fairly painful, since a lot of the trees had been rebased, and the
ones that hadn&apos;t been rebased often had some extra patches that still
showed up when I did my &quot;git log linux-next..FETCH_HEAD&quot; thing.</para>
    <para>On the whole, most of it was all good, and I didn&apos;t really end up
complaining to people. I&apos;m pretty sure that there were trees I
shouldn&apos;t have let through, but the majority really had been in -next. (...)</para>

    <para>Ok, we&apos;re a week away from the kernel summit, and here&apos;s the last -rc
I&apos;m planning to make.</para>
    <para>There really hasn&apos;t been all that much going on - the smallish MIPS
updates are still the bulk of this -rc, and the rest is pretty much
small driver fixes. Oh, and some last-minute fs (btrfs and xfs) fixes
in there too.</para>
    <para>The shortlog is about as informative as it gets. There&apos;s still some
discussion about a couple of minor things we would like to get
resolved, but on the whole 3.1 is long over-due and by the KS I think
everybody will be relieved to have it out, and ready to open the merge
window. (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Optimised assembler code paths accelerate SHA1 and speed up the
        Blowfish and Twofish encryption algorithms. The next scheduled Linux kernel release avoids a
        cache problem found in AMD's latest processors and includes new and extended drivers for
        Intel CPUs.</emphasis></para>
    <para>In keeping with the usual weekly release rhythm, Linus Torvalds <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1223327">issued</ulink> the fourth release
      candidate of Linux 3.2 last Friday. It contains fewer changes than the two previous RCs, and
      Torvalds said that "things really are calming down pretty nicely", adding that it is even
      "suspiciously quiet." With the development of Linux 3.2 in progress, the Kernel Log is
      continuing its "Coming in 3.2" mini series. After describing the advancements in the kernel's

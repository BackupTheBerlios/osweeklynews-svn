        3.0-rc2</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>You all know the drill by now: another week, another -rc.  It's been reasonably quiet,
      although the btrfs update is bigger than I was hoping for. Other than that, it's mostly driver
      fixes, some ubifs updates too, and a few reverts for the early regressions.  But -rc2 is
      already small enough that it easily fits as an appended shortlog, and hopefully things will
      stay calm. Of course, part of that may be due to other people also havin been busy traveling,
      so let's see (and hope for the best). And I haven't been super-eager to pull, so there is a
      couple of pending requests still in my mail queue. </para>

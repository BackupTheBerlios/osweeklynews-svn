    <para><emphasis role="bold">Among the additions for kernel version .39 are the Xen network
        backend, support for ipset, and the rudimentary Poulsbo graphics driver; the kernel hackers
        have now also completely eradicated the BKL. Greg Kroah-Hartman has taken up maintaining the
        series 33 kernel again because it is the basis of the real-time branch.</emphasis></para>

      a meaningful Dom0 has not yet made it into the kernel.</para>
    <para>As expected, the last remaining components that use the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) have now
      been removed, allowing the kernel hackers to completely eradicate the lock via a commit

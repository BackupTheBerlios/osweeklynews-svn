                Filesystems</ulink>
        </title>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The kernel hackers have optimised the Btrfs code and extended it
                to include new functions; a substantially improved tool for testing the experimental
                filesystem is soon to be released. Ext4 now supports the "punch hole" technology for
                deallocating unused memory areas within a file.</emphasis></para>
        <para>Early this week, Linus Torvalds released a new pre-release (RC) for Linux 3.0. In the
            release mail for the <ulink url="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1157753"
                >fourth RC</ulink>, he mentions some more extensive changes to the DRM subsystem.
            Among those changes are <ulink
                url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.dri.devel/58481">patches </ulink>that
            improve support for the graphics core of AMD's recently introduced Llano, which was
            introduced between <ulink

                >RC2 and RC3</ulink>.</para>
        <para>The Kernel Log is taking the development progress of Linux 3.0 as an opportunity to
            continue its "Coming in 3.0" mini series with a description of the advancements in terms
            of filesystems. Partý1 of the mini-series discussed the changes to the <ulink

                >network drivers and infrastructure</ulink>; over the coming weeks, further articles
            will discuss the kernel's graphics drivers, architecture code, storage support,
            infrastructure and other hardware drivers.</para>

        <para>Mostly the usual small driver one- (or few-) liners, and some bigger changes to drm
            (and md). But also two new smallish drivers (net/usb/kalmia.c, and the ADP8870 backlight
            driver). Some filesystem fixes (btrfs, cifs, afs, xfs, nfsd). </para>
        <para>And a couple of performance regressions: rcu doesn't need threads (and avoiding them
            fixes a performance problem under certain loads) and the conversion from spinlocks to
            mutexes for the anon_vma locking ended up causing a scalability issue that required
            fixing.  (...)</para>

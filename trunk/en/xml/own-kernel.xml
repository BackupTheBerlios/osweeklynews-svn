  <title>Kernel Review</title>

      <ulink url="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1182531">Linus Torvalds: Linux 3.1-rc3</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>It&apos;s a day late - I was just too hungry tired after the DM class to
release it yesterday. But there it is, all fresh and new.</para>
    <para>And a few thank-yous are in order: things are looking good. The
diffstat looks reasonable (the one big addition is in Documentation),
and while I could have wished for even less churn, I&apos;m pretty happy.
The rc2 to rc3 shortlog is appended, and I think it mostly looks
pretty reasonable and short. Which is not to say that I&apos;m not hoping
that things will calm down even further in the later rc&apos;s, but at
least so far I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had much reason to complain.</para>
    <para>Another thank-you goes to Intel: this release has been full of travel
(happily now all completed), first due to a week of vacation during
the merge window, and then for my DM class weekends and LinuxCon. And
the new laptop made it much less painful to do even &quot;allmodconfig&quot;
builds while on the road.</para>
    <para>So go out and test. (...)</para>

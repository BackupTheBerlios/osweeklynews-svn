    <para>Thomas Gleixner has released the first test version of a real-time (RT) Linux kernel based
      on a current release candidate of Linux kernel version 3.0; having been <ulink

        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.rt.user/6861">released</ulink> any day now. With
      version 3.0-rc7-rt0, the developers have taken the biggest step towards a modern basis for
        the <ulink url="https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">RT kernel</ulink>, a kernel
      that is chiefly maintained by Gleixner and several other developers – the current stable
      kernel with real-time capabilities is still based on the Linux 2.6.33 series, which Greg
      Kroah-Hartman has <ulink

    <title><ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/452040/rss">LWN: The 3.0 kernel is
      out</ulink></title>
    <para>Linus has <ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/452531/">announced</ulink> the release of
      the 3.0 kernel. "As already mentioned several times, there are no special landmark features or
      incompatibilities related to the version number change, it's simply a way to drop an
      inconvenient numbering system in honor of twenty years of Linux. In fact, the 3.0 merge window
      was calmer than most, and apart from some excitement from RCU I'd have called it really
      smooth." Beyond the numbering scheme change, this kernel includes <ulink
        url="http://lwn.net/Articles/429925/">POSIX alarm timer support</ulink>, a <ulink
        url="http://lwn.net/Articles/437981/">just-in-time compiler</ulink> for BPF packet filters,
      a new sendmmsg() system call, <ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/420799/">ICMP
        sockets</ulink>, the merging of the Xen backend driver (completing the long process of
      getting Xen Dom0 support into the kernel), <ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/407495/"
        >namespace file descriptors</ulink>, and more. See the <ulink

        systems</ulink>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Various internal changes to the block layer that were specifically
        mentioned by Linus Torvalds are designed to enhance performance and scalability. The Ext4
        file system is also said to offer improvements in this respect. Still classified as
        experimental, Btrfs now offers Batched Discard functionality, and LIO (Linux-Iscsi.org)
        includes a loop-back function.</emphasis></para>
    <para>At the end of last week, Andi Kleen published a <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1129793">series of patches</ulink> that
      fixes a performance problem between the Virtual File System (VFS) and the security
      infrastructure; this was an unwanted side effect from the <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-2-File-systems-1192694.html"
        >optimisation to the VFS</ulink> that was merged in Linux 2.6.38. Torvalds showed <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1129793/focus%3D52980">great
        interest</ulink> in them and <ulink
        url="http://git.kernel.org/linus/8c9e80ed276fc4b9c9fadf29d8bf6b3576112f1a">merged
        one</ulink> into the main development tree; a second fix that is based on the three patches
      from Kleen <ulink url="http://git.kernel.org/linus/9ade0cf440a1e5800dc68eef2e77b8d9d83a6dff"
        >followed on Monday</ulink> and fixes the problem in the SELinux codebase. It's still
      undecided if these or similar patches will make it into a stable kernel 2.6.38, as Torvalds
      mentioned at one point that he was considering.</para>
    <para>Torvalds did not yet produce a fifth release candidate for Linux 2.6.39 – but it should
      emerge in the next few days, as the <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1128248">RC4</ulink> is already more than
      one week old. (...)</para>

        >h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel comment: Perseverance pays off</ulink></title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Today, there are open source Linux drivers for all major Wi-Fi
        chips, which was unimaginable five years ago. The constant pressure for open source drivers
        has thus paid off, and this may also work in other areas in the long term.</emphasis></para>
    <para><quote>Buy a Centrino notebook, and then the Wi-Fi chipset will work with Linux</quote>.
      Five years ago, such simplifications were more common because a lot of the Wi-Fi components
      either did not run on Linux or took a lot of tweaking, say, with Ndiswrapper and Driverloader
      to get the NDIS drivers intended for use with Windows to run on Linux. Internet forums
      contained thousands of comments on these issues, and people repeatedly said that the Linux
      kernel needed a stable API for external drivers; otherwise, manufacturers would never offer
      proper Linux drivers for Wi-Fi hardware.</para>
    <para>We now know that such a step was not necessary, for all major manufacturers of Wi-Fi
      hardware for PCs and notebooks are currently working on open source drivers maintained within
      work on the Linux kernel.</para>

    </title>
    <para>So things have sadly not continued to calm down even further. We had
      more commits in -rc4 than we had in -rc3, and I sincerely hope that
      upward trend doesn&apos;t continue.
      
    </para>
    <para>That said, so far the only thing that has really caused problems this
      release cycle has been the block layer plugging changes, and as of
      -rc4 the issues we had with MD should hopefully now be behind us. So
      we&apos;re making progress on that front too.
      
    </para>
    <para>The plugging code still seems to trigger some issue with what looks
      like an infinite stream of disk-change notifications on CD-ROMs - but
      Jens is hopefully going to squish that problem soon. In the meantime,
      you can avoid the problem by either running SMP or having preemption
      enabled.
      
    </para>
    <para>Other than that? We may have a bit more commits than in -rc3, but it
      hasn&apos;t been _too_ bad. There&apos;s certainly nothing overly exciting:
      aside from the block/MD fixups, we&apos;ve got some filesystem updates
      (btrfs, cifs and ubifs) and some driver updates (the largest chunk of
      which is actually a duplicate driver removal). USB, some KMS, nothing
      really earthshaking.
      
    </para>
    <para>Shortlog appended for the curious. (...)</para>

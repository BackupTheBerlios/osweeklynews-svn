SubjectLinux 3.1-rc5


So it&apos;s been another week, and it&apos;s time for another -rc.

</para>
    <para>However, master.kernel.org is still down, and there really hasn&apos;t been
a ton of development going on, so I considered just skipping a week.
But hey, the whole point (well, *one* of the points) of distributed
development is that no single place is really any different from any
other, so since I did a github account for my divelog thing, why not
see how well it holds up to me just putting my whole kernel repo there
too?</para>
    <para>So while kernel.org is down for the count, let&apos;s just see how github does:

    <para>NOTE! One thing to look out for when you see a new random public
hosting place usage like that is to verify that yes, it&apos;s really the
person you think it is. So is it? (...)</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">The software RAID code now supports bad block management and dm-crypt can notify SSDs about freed storage areas. The iSCSI target framework LIO has been updated to Version 4.1 and the default Ext3 settings make the filesystem more robust, but a bit slower.</emphasis></para>
    <para>On Monday morning, Linus Torvalds <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1187888">released</ulink> the fifth pre-release version of Linux 3.1. It is currently only available from <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Linux-development-temporarily-moves-to-GitHub-1336692.html">GitHub</ulink>, with the kernel.org infrastructure still restricted following the <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Security-breach-at-kernel-org-1334642.html">recent hack</ulink>. In his release email, Torvalds notes that there is little to report on the development front. That is partly a result of the confusion caused by the kernel.org hack, which has affected the flow of patches.</para>
    <para>In light of the ongoing development of Linux 3.1, the Kernel Log is continuing its &apos;Coming in 3.1&apos; series by describing new features relating to storage code and filesystems. The first of this series of articles looked at changes to <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-1-Networking-1323463.html">network drivers and infrastructure</ulink>; articles on architecture code, infrastructure and drivers for other hardware will follow over the next few weeks.

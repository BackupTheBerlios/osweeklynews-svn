    >h-online/Thorsten Leemhuis: Kernel Log: native KVM tool, new kernels galore</ulink>
  </title>
  <para><emphasis role="bold">Dissatisfied with the Qemu code, the developers have created a simple
    emulation tool for KVM. The latest drivers for Intel graphics chips improve the kernel's support
    for the video components of various current processors; a wealth of new long-term and stable
    kernels fix bugs and security holes.</emphasis></para>
  <para>In late March, Pekka Enberg <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1121307"
    >announced</ulink> on the LKML the development of a native KVM tool. This tool emulates some of
   the hardware components that guest systems access during operation; in KVM virtualisation, this
   task is nowadays mostly handled by a QEMU derivative, created and maintained as part of the KVM
   project. The KVM code within the kernel works in close co-operation with this emulation code,
   ensuring that the required processor resources are allocated; however, a few hardware components
   such as the interrupt controller are emulated by the KVM kernel code itself, because this
   considerably enhances performance.</para>
  <para>In his email, Enberg writes that his aim was to create a light-weight and clean KVM
   emulation implementation that can boot Linux guests. The developer said that the tool is "[...]
   just a hobby, won't be big and professional like QEMU [...]" – a play on the words Linus Torvalds
   used in his first email about the development of Linux. (..)</para>

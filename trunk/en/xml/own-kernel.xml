    <para>Hello world, and welcome to the first edition of KWN for 2011! Long talk is no fun, so
      let’s jump into it! </para>
    <para>We start this week’s news with Dan Williams, who has a pull requests for .38 regarding the
      async_tx tree
      :<screen>Hi Linus, please pull from:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/async_tx.git next

...to receive:

1/ An overhaul of the amba-pl08x driver by Russell who caught a lot of
issues in this experimental driver that really should have been caught
before the initial merge.

2/ A collection of small updates and fixes across fsldma, dma40,
intel-mid, and iop-adma.

All but the last two amba-pl08x patches have appeared in a -next
release.

Thanks,
Dan </screen></para>
    <para>-Dave Airlie has some drm fixes, fixes that are described as follows
      :<screen>Hi everyone,

The for-linus branch of the btrfs-unstable git tree:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable.git for-linus

Has our collection of features and fixes for 2.6.38-rc1.  The git tree
is actually against 2.6.36 and these commits have been tested against
.36, .37 and Linus' current git.  There's no particular reason for the
.36 part, other than it's what one of my build boxes was running.

The highlights this time around are LZO compression from Li Zefan and a
large collection of multi-device fixes from Miao Xie.  Liubo kicked in
the start of our forced-readonly support, which will be the building
block for ripping out a big collection of BUG_ONs and replacing them
with kinder gentler error messages.

Li Zefan also added readonly snapshot support, and I'll have the
corresponding btrfs-progs changes integrated this week.

This pull does have a duplicate for the btrfs ctree.c build fix that
Linus already has in his tree.  Git merge seems to do magic on this one,
it applies without doing a duplicate #include.</screen></para>
    <para>, also we have a infiniband-related request from Roland Dreier and , last but not least,
      it’s Al Viro again with autofs cleanups and fixes.</para>

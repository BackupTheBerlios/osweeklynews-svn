    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Kernel version 3.1 will probably be released in the next few days. After
        a break of more than four weeks, Greg Kroah-Hartman has released new stable kernels. The
        X.org developers are thinking about merging the most important graphics drivers into the
        X-Server.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>Late last Tuesday night, Linus Torvalds <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1199406">issued</ulink> the ninth release
      candidate of Linux 3.1. Since then, some further corrections have been integrated into the
      main development branch; however, in the past few days there have not been any new hints on
      when Linux 3.1 might get released – but it is likely to be released some time this week, or
      next week at the latest, as <ulink

        >indicated</ulink> by Torvalds when releasing RC7.</para>
    <para>Linus Torvalds explained in his <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1199406">release email</ulink> that in RC9,
      a new GPG key for signing Git tags has been used for the first time. The new key is said to be
      stronger than the old one and has already been signed by more developers who are known to
      Torvalds; however, the tag has also been signed with the old key.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Linux 3.1 comes with all the components that are required for using the 3D acceleration features of various current GeForce graphics chips. The Intel graphics driver is still not using an important power saving mechanism by default. The kernel now supports the Creative Titanium HD.</emphasis></para>
    <para>In the early hours of Thursday morning, Linus Torvalds released the seventh release
      candidate of Linux 3.1. In the <ulink url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1193980">release-mail for RC7</ulink> and in a <ulink url="https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/RDMrsVFQMLu">Google+ post</ulink>
      he says that he is starting to get ready to release 3.1; however, as he explains, it would not
      be practical to have the merge window for Linux 3.2 (which follows the release of 3.1) without
      kernel.org – the servers have not been reachable for two weeks now, while they are being
      reinstalled or checked after the <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Security-breach-at-kernel-org-1334642.html">recent break-in</ulink>. Torvalds also mentioned that he&apos;ll be on vacation in early October and
      indicated that he would not release 3.1 before he comes back. That, according to Torvalds,
      would result in the merge window overlapping with this year&apos;s <ulink url="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-kernel-summit">Kernel Summit</ulink>,
      which takes place from 23 to 25 October. A release of Linux 3.1 before 9 October is therefore
      highly unlikely at this point.</para>
    <para>Due to the approaching finalisation of the new version, the Kernel Log will complete its
      &quot;Coming in 3.1&quot; mini series with a discussion of the Linux kernel&apos;s hardware support
      improvements. Part 1 of the mini series provided an overview of the changes related to <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-1-Networking-1323463.html">network drivers and infrastructure</ulink>, while part 2 discussed the kernel&apos;s <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-2-Storage-and-filesystems-1338160.html">storage code and filesystems</ulink> and part 3 its <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-3-1-Part-3-Architecture-infrastructure-virtualisation-1345178.html">architecture, infrastructure and virtualisation</ulink>.</para>

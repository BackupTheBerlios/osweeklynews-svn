    </title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Numerous changes to the network and storage code are to increase processing speed and improve the system's hardware support. Among the new additions are a PPTP stack, various drivers for Wi-Fi hardware by Atheros, Broadcom and Realtek, and code for hard disks with a logical sector size of 4 Kbytes.</emphasis></para>

        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1072835/focus%3D1073162">Tony Luck last week
        projected</ulink> that the final version 2.6.37 could well be released before Christmas, as
      things have apparently been running very smoothly. Linus Torvalds has a similar, although not
      quite as optimistic a view: he said that even if things run smoothly, he doesn't think anybody
      wants the merge window open over the holidays. Torvalds <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1072835/focus%3D1073162">therefore
        anticipates</ulink> that unless new problems appear and cause delay, he will release kernel
      version 2.6.37 in early January, . </para>
    <para>The Kernel Log will continue its <quote>Coming in 2.6.37</quote> mini series with a discussion of the
      advances in terms of storage and network hardware drivers and infrastructure. <ulink

      will discuss the changes to the kernel's architecture code, drivers and surrounding
      infrastructure.  (...)</para>

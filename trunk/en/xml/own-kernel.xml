    <para><emphasis role="bold">The kernel now supports USB 3.0 hubs, the latest Radeon graphics
        cards and Intel's previously problematic GMA500 graphics. Other new additions include

        various other vendors.</emphasis></para>
    <para>Linus Torvalds released the seventh pre-release of Linux 2.6.39 on Monday night. He wrote:
        <quote>So things have been pretty quiet, and unless something major comes up I believe that
        this will be the last -rc</quote>. If Torvalds sticks to his usual work patterns, then

    <para>As Linux 2.6.39 is approaching completion, the Kernel Log will conclude its "Coming in

      audio, graphics and multimedia hardware drivers. Part 1 of the mini series discussed the
      changes to the network drivers and infrastructure; part 2 was about the file system code as
      well as the storage drivers and infrastructure; and part 3 discussed the architecture code and
      general infrastructure. (...)</para>

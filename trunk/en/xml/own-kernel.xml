    <para><emphasis role="bold">Linux 3.1 contains all the necessary components for passing through
        PCI devices to Xen guests; KVM offers rudimentary nested virtualisation support for Intel
        CPUs. Supported CPU platforms now include the OpenRISC open source processor
        architecture.</emphasis></para>
    <para>Late last Monday night, Linus Torvalds marked the sixth release candidate of Linux 3.1 on
      GitHub; however, due to emailing problems, the <ulink
        url="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1191106">announcement</ulink> of RC6 only
      reached the LKML on Wednesday. In his announcement, Torvalds said that the RC only contains
      just over one hundred commits, and that things have been fairly quiet. This relative quiet is
      probably a side effect of the <ulink
        url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Security-breach-at-kernel-org-1334642.html">break-in
        at kernel.org</ulink> and the resulting maintenance work, which has meant that the kernel
      developers have had to <ulink

    <para>The Kernel Log will take the Linux 3.1 development progress as an opportunity to continue
      its "Coming in 3.1" mini series with a discussion of the advancements in the kernel's
      architecture, infrastructure and virtualisation areas. Partý1 of the mini series provided an
      overview of the changes in terms of <ulink

      article on drivers. (...)</para>

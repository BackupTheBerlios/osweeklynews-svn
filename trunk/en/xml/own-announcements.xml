    </title>
    <para>Yesterday marked the official start of Google Summer of Code’s Coding Period. And openSUSE
      mentors are right in the thick of it working with 16 students seeking to make a better world
      in FOSS.</para>
    <para>openSUSE can take particular pride in GSoC further supporting the openSUSE goal of
      creating an environment that supports not only openSUSE but FOSS in general. Indeed we are
      mentoring several projects that directly benefit openSUSE, but there’s also several projects
      that support other projects, like the Arch Linux backend for our Open Build Service, a test
      suite for btrfs, ext4 snapshots in snapper, PackageKit backend in Software Center, and ICC
      device profile repository.<blockquote>
        <para>I do believe that our main contribution is that we will be sharing our enthusiasm
          about Free Software with our students and students from other organizations. And this is
          what will, hopefully, keep the students involved in the Free Software world after GSoC.
            <emphasis role="italic">– Vincent Untz, openSUSE GSoC Organizer</emphasis></para>
      </blockquote>And it is true that students are already experiencing the spirit of the openSUSE
      Project. As student Alex Eftimie says:</para>
    <para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>What can I say? I’m excited about everything. openSUSE is the perfect umbrella for
          such a project. What I like most about it is that the result will be usable in a
          cross-distro fashion. Until GSoC, I wasn’t familiar with openSUSE efforts on
          collaboration. Package management is a domain where distros can do better, and I’m glad to
          be a part of this effort.</para>
      </blockquote>

    <para>You can see the complete list of student projects we’re working with <ulink url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-04/msg00495.html">here</ulink>.</para>
    <para>Pavol Rusnak, our other openSUSE GSoC organizer, reminds us that there are also some
      long-standing tasks directly beneitting the openSUSE Project which will now be tackled by some
      of our student projects.</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>With projects like Open Build Service for Android, a new python OBS library, and
        solutions to enhance SUSE Studio and YaST, we’ll be further strengthening some of the unique
        selling points of openSUSE.</para>

      <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/26/opensuse-renames-obs/">openSUSE renames OBS</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>The openSUSE Build Service Team has decided to rename its cutting-edge packaging- and
      distribution build technology to Open Build Service. The new name, while maintaining the
      well-known OBS acronym, signals its open and cross-distribution nature.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The history</emphasis></para>
    <para>The openSUSE Buildservice started out as an internal SUSE technology. In 2006 it was
      decided to open its source code and development process. From that point on, the scope of the
      openSUSE Build Service started to widen. First, it was just there to build add-on packages for
      SUSE Linux. Later on it became able to build openSUSE itself and to support also non-SUSE
      distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, MeeGo and others) and packaging systems (rpm, debian, kiwi),
      now expanded to 21 build targets on 6 architectures. We will support even more systems in
      future, non-Linux targets and also more specialized Linux targets like maintenance channels.
      But while ‘OBS’ is meant for a much wider audience than openSUSE, being used by projects and
      companies like VLC, MeeGo, Dell and many others, its name misleadingly signaled a
      distribution-specific purpose.</para>
    <para>OBS is a unique piece of technology and certainly deserves to be known and used by a wide
      audience. With features like integration with Source Code Management systems including GIT and
      Subversion and powerful collaborative features has made the public instance on <ulink url="http://build.opensuse.org">build.opensuse.org</ulink> the preferred build technology
      for well over 27,000 users.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Communication</emphasis></para>
    <para>In highlighting the benefits of OBS to the masses, the over-reaching assumption that the
      service is openSUSE-specfic proved to be a deterrent. It clearly takes additional effort to
      convince a potential user that despite the name, openSUSE Build Service was not <emphasis role="italic">just</emphasis> for openSUSE. And the distribution-independent technological
      benefits became lost in the confusion. This effect is very apparent in face to face
      communication as you’ll almost immediately hear others saying <quote>No, I’m a Fedora packager, this has nothing to do with me. Sorry</quote>. when they hear about OBS. This same
      effect lead to less people reading articles or attending talks on the subject.</para>
    <para>And while this was an undesirable effect for us promoting one of the key features of the
      openSUSE Project, we also recognized this was preventing developers and packagers wanting to
      promote and distribute their software projects from benefiting from a service that would truly
      enable them to achieve that goal.</para>
    <para>As our openSUSE ambassadors around the world have been stepping up our communication and
      promotion around OBS, they have noticed this effect. After some discussion on the
      international marketing mailing list it was agreed to recommend the OBS team to rename their
      technology to Open Build Service. This would retain the OBS acronym and excellent search
      engine position at the slight expense of a weakened link between the openSUSE community, where
      OBS originated, and the Build Service currently lives.</para>
    <para>But it would clearly signal the open and collaborative nature of OBS and allow OBS to
      spread its wings and reach an even wider audience, benefiting all of Free Software. And that
      has always and continues to be the higher goal of the openSUSE Project.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Decicion</emphasis></para>
    <para>So after ample deliberation and discussion with all the major stakeholders, the OBS team
      agreed that it would be beneficial to rename the openSUSE Build Service to <ulink url="http://open-build-service.org/">Open Build Service</ulink>. It is and will remain an
      openSUSE project, with significant contributions from SUSE and openSUSE community members as
      well as many others from communities like MeeGo and VLC but also be more clear about its
      cross-distribution, cross-project goals and ambitions.</para>
    <para>The branding part of OBS will be adapted to make it easy for projects deploying their own
      OBS to name their OBS while staying connected with the OBS project. We suggest to name a
      project-specific OBS instance <quote>XXX Open Build Service</quote>, like <quote>VLC Open Build Service</quote>. The new domain name for the project will be <ulink url="http://open-build-service.org/">openbuildservice.org</ulink>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reaction</emphasis></para>
    <para>Of course, we at openSUSE are very happy with this change. And so are our friends and
      users of OBS!</para>
    <para>Ralph Dehner, CEO at B1 systems notes:</para>
    <para>“In the past B1 Systems has written build environments for the customers by itself. With
      the open Build Service now exists a “standard” which makes it easy to build packages for
      different distributions and architectures.</para>
    <para>This will be also interesting for many other open source projects.”</para>
    <para>“The Linux Foundation views OBS as an important and useful tool for building software for
      Linux,” said Amanda McPherson, vice president of marketing and developer program for the Linux
      Foundation. “As adoption of OBS has increased, it’s a natural step to rename it to reflect its
      open nature and cross-distribution support.”</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Enterprise Support</emphasis></para>
    <para>As OBS has matured and becomes more widespread, SUSE has <ulink url="http://www.novell.com/prblogs/?p=3787">decided</ulink> to help organizations who want
      to use and deploy it. SUSE OBS Developer Support brings commercial support options for
      customers and partners that want to run their own instance of the Open Build Service.</para>
    <para>The support offering will be handled via a new OBS Developer Services (DS) program. Under
      this program, customers will receive support for configuration and setup issues as well as the
      ability to get code fixes for bugs that affect them. As part of this program, SUSE is also
      collecting requirements to the OBS software and will input this into the planning process for
      OBS. SUSE will be working with partners to enable and back them to offer implementation and
      consulting services.</para>

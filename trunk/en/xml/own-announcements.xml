        >Andreas Jaeger: openSUSE Release versioning – Poll on last three options</ulink></title>
    <para>The poll on SurveyMonkey on how to version the openSUSE distribution release is now
      closed, you can see the results <ulink

        >here</ulink>. The winner is the “old school” (like currently but only counting the right
      number until 3), followed by “Fedora style” (just integers) and “Ubuntu style” (2 digits year
      “.” 2 digits month).</para>

    <para>Just a few months ago, the XFCE project announcedý<ulink
        url="http://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1295136000">XFCE 4.8</ulink>,ýthe result of over 2
      years of hard work. This desktop, one of the four official desktops of <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/">openSUSE 11.4</ulink>, brings many
      new features. If you’re not having fun in the desktops provided by KDE or GNOME you should
      have a close look at XFCE (or the lightweight LXDE). To show you how it’s done, I checked out
      XFCE and wrote about my experience.</para>

    <para>To test XFCE <xref linkend="xfce"/> I went into <ulink url="http://susestudio.com">SUSE Studio</ulink> and
      created an XFCE 4.8 image. After some clicking around (slimming a standard GNOME down to XFCE)
      I had built a hard disk image. If you do this yourself, notice that by default, SUSE Studio
      does not install ‘recommended’ packages from patterns. This can be enabled – and you surely
      should do that if you want a decent XFCE!</para>
    <para>The ability to just write an image to an usb disk and have it resize itself to the size of
      the whole stick at first boot is awesome. You can just install software and in general won’t
      notice you work on an USB stick! That is truly a portable OS… (...)</para>

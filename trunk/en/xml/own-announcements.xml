    <para>Over the last month the conference team has received a large number of proposed sessions
      for the openSUSE conference. However, we also realize we have not entirely capitalized on the
      potential for especially the ‘interactive’ sessions we wanted. So we extend the deadline with
      two weeks to allow more BoF, Workshop and Hack sessions to be submitted. And we’ll release
      some more articles to explain what we want!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Interactive</emphasis></para>
    <para>As we wrote in the initial <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/"
        >call for papers</ulink>, it is our ambition to make the openSUSE conference about community
      and getting things done. Two-way communication, not one-way! Interactivity, creativity, fun.
      The awesome <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Location_Zentrifuge"
        >Zentrifuge</ulink> location is there to inspire us and we choose the subtitle of <emphasis
        role="bold">rwxý</emphasis>, commonly known as the UNIX acronym for <emphasis role="italic"
        >“Read, Write, Execute”</emphasis> for our conference.</para>
    <para>More importantly, we asked for ‘interactive session proposals’. And that is also where we
      failed a bit. Not everyone in openSUSE is familiar with workshops, BoFs or Hack sessions. We
      introduced <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/">the
        BoF in an article</ulink> but the other sessions have not seen any explanation besides what
      can be found on the <ulink

    </title>
    <para>In our last article focusing on openSUSE Conference sessions, <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/">we
        discussed the BoF</ulink>. In today’s article, we’ll explore the why, what and how of a
      workshop.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Teach Them To Fish</emphasis></para>
    <para>Remember how it is better to teach a man to fish than to bring him food? This is exactly
      what a workshop is all about. You can choose to be a one-man show doing all the work yourself,
      or you can teach others to join in with you and make your particular software project even
      stronger. And with our RWX³ theme, the openSUSE Conference is the perfect host for your
      workshop.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">What happens in a workshop?</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3380846039_2f6eb6ca5e.jpg"
        align="right" width="20%"/></para>
    <para>Unlike the BoF, which is a free-form event focusing on a specific topic or set of topics,
      a workshop is more rigid and provides a specific roadmap and expected goals upon the
      completion of the session. </para>
    <para>For example, at the openSUSE conference a series of workshops on packaging on OBS will be
      done by Lars Mueller, Pascal Bleser and several other packaging masters. At the end,
      participants know how to build a package properly on OBS and how to submit it to a devel
      project.</para>
    <para>Commonly, a workshop at a FOSS event usually is a hands-on lab environment providing
      step-by-step instructions and exercises. You may even have a series of workshops targeting
      specific levels of expertise. However, you shouldn’t assume that all workshops are hands-on
      lab style. They can be discussion-type or training, such as a workshop that goes through a
      series of exercises on how to be an effective presentation speaker.</para>
    <para>If you’re a developer, project manager, or team lead, there’s a good chance that a
      workshop can fit exactly what you need in order to expand the effectiveness of your
      project.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Designing Your Workshop</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Planning:</emphasis></para>
    <para>You need to plan ahead and have a clear vision of what you want your audience to know by
      the time your workshop is completed. The most important factor to keep in mind is the
      available time needed to accomplish your goal. You may be tempted to dump a lot of knowledge
      onto your audience within a short time-frame, but that usually backfires in the long
      run.</para>
    <para>In the Virtualization workshop at the openSUSE conference, Bruno Friedman has decided to
      focus on just one of the major VM technologies: KVM. Explaining them all simply doesn’t work
      in one hour.</para>
    <para>Things to consider in relation to time are: Amount of actual time, presentation time (how
      much time it takes for you to lecture), exercise time (how much time it takes for your
      audience to complete exercises), Q&amp;A time, and preparing for the unexpected (egads!
      There’s no network connectivity in this room?!?).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Identify Your Audience</emphasis></para>
    <para>Make sure you are clear about what audience you wish to have in your workshop. Do you want
      to teach users how to use your software? Do you want to teach developers how to code and
      submit patches for your software? Do you want to teach packagers tips and tricks for good
      packaging methods?</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Be Clear</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/3692413196_3f0c97c1bf_m.jpg"
        align="right"/></para>
    <para>Once you’ve identified your time frame, audience, and goals, it is important to be clear
      about what you can do within those constraints. It can be very tempting to cram a lot of
      information into such a short period of time, but usually your audience won’t be able to
      retain all those details. In fact, if you really need to give lots of information, consider
      breaking it up into a series of workshops where your audience can gradually learn at
      increasing levels.</para>
    <para>Depending on your time frame, consider the top most important things your audience should
      learn. If it is a one-hour workshop, try to limit this to three things. If it is a two-hour
      workshop, consider maybe 5 things to learn. If four hours… well you get the drift here.</para>
    <para>For the packaging workshop the focus is on three things: how to get a basic package
      building for openSUSE, how to create a merge request for a devel project, and how to manage
      and guide that request so the merge is successful.</para>
    <para>If you want to provide more information than you have time for, consider giving handouts
      that explain information in depth, point to articles or resources on the web, or create
      take-home exercises that your audience can do in their own time.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Identify Resources</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4589560952_c3fcc4b575_m.jpg"
        align="right"/></para>
    <para>Once you have determined what you want to do in these workshops, you need to identify the
      resources required to make the workshop effective. Are computers needed? If so, should the
      audience bring their own laptops or will you provide them? If you provide them, what do you
      need to do to prepare those machines? If your audience brings a laptop, what do they need to
      have on their machines?</para>
    <para>For the VM workshop you will need to have a KVM capable kernel and a virtual image (made
      in SUSE Studio) will be provided. The team for the packaging workshop has prepared source
      tarballs and links to git repositories to be build on OBS.</para>
    <para>Another question is what you, giving a workshop, need to bring. Are handouts required?
      What kind of information is required in those handouts? Will you be able to print them in time
      for the event? Will you be giving a slide presentation throughout your workshop? Is a
      projector needed?</para>
    <para>Finally, think about access to the network or internet during your workshop and if you
      should provide necessary software by passing around USB keys? This is something the conference
      organization can help you with, of course! But you will have to let us know in time…</para>
    <para><tip>
        <para>Use SUSE Studio to create a fully set-up development environment and add a link to the
          image in your workshop description. The conference team would be happy to have this as
          addition once the workshop is approved.</para>
      </tip>Clearly identifying all your resource needs ahead of time will make the workshop run
      much more smoothly.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Clarity</emphasis></para>
    <para>In your abstract, be very clear about what your workshop will achieve. If the abstract
      does not match the actual workshop as closely as possible, your audience may end up being
      disappointed, no matter what they learn. Set forth the goals and expected outcome of your
      workshop and make sure they know what they need to bring, if anything, to the workshop. Here’s
      an example of an abstract.<blockquote>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">In this workshop, you will learn techniques for creating
            awesome videos using professional-grade software available on your Linux desktop.
            Together, we will use footage provided by the lecturer to edit and join scenes together
            to create dazzling montages worthy of a Cannes Film Festival.</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">Students must bring their own laptop and be able to connect to
            the internet through a browser. Also, the following software should be installed on your
            machine prior to the workshop: Cinelerra, foo-x, foo-y, foo-z.</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">Prerequisite: A basic knowledge of video
          editing.</emphasis></para>
      </blockquote></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Practice Makes Perfect</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/5409916350_3d88a8acab_m.jpg"
        align="right"/></para>
    <para>There is nothing worse than an unprepared workshop. You should practice your workshop
      lectures and exercises before beginning your session. Sit down through the exercise steps and
      make sure they are clear to your audience.</para>
    <para>Make sure your entire workshop fits within your allotted time-frame. Chances are, you’ll
      need to make some adjustments before you arrive at your session. Review all materials and ask
      colleagues to review with you. Consider utilizing the resources of the openSUSE Conference
      Team. We have volunteers willing to help with reviewing your workshop!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Benefits</emphasis></para>
    <para>As you can see, designing a workshop does require a bit of preparation. But the rewards of
      your workshop will far outweigh the time you put into the design. If you’re teaching users how
      to make the best of your software, you can ensure long-term popularity for your project. If
      you’re teaching developers, you can expand your contributor base, thus improving the potential
      for your software. And most importantly, we’ll do our best to promote your workshop at our
      Conference.</para>
    <para>So, consider submitting a proposal for a workshop at the openSUSE Conference. Even if you
      have an idea but aren’t sure how to plan for a workshop, submit your proposal. Our Conference
      Team will be more than happy to advise, assist, review or provide any other resources you
      need. After all, every good proposal starts with an idea. :-)</para>

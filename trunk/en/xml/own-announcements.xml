        >App Installer Meeting or More Collaboration Accross Borders</ulink></title>
    <para>Back in October, at the <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/26/2010/10/25/thanks-for-your-participation-at-the-opensuse-conference/"
        >openSUSE Conference</ulink>, several meetings and hallway discussions occurred on the topic
      of “Installation ofApplications” on openSUSE. As of today, we still have a very
      package-centric approach, while users usually do not think in terms of packages but in terms
      of applications: people want to use Firefox, LibreOffice or Frozen Bubble.</para>

    <para>We investigated the best way to approach this issue and come to a fast resolution. With
      several people from various distributions already working on some technologies that are
      related to this, we realized this could be a prime example of Collaboration Accross Borders.
      This lead Vincent Untz to contact several people from different distributions, to see if he
      could spark an interest in a cross-distribution meeting on this topic. It turned out that
      everyone replied enthusiastically! That’s how the <ulink
        url="http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/Meetings/AppInstaller2011">App Installer
        Meeting</ulink> saw the light. </para>
    <para>This meeting occurred over three days last week at the Novell/SUSE offices in Nuremberg,
      with 15ish participants, from five distributions: Debian (Enrico Zini, David Kalnischkies),
      Fedora (Richard Hughes, Florian Festi), Mageia (Michael Scherer, Olivier Thauvin, Samuel
      Verschelde), openSUSE (Duncan Mac-Vicar, Michael Schroeder, Pavol Rusnak, Vincent Untz),
      Ubuntu (Michael Vogt, Sebastian Heinlein). Frank Karlitschek and Garrett LeSage joined this
      group of distribution-oriented people. This was a fantastic set of people to tackle the topic,
      some of those having a background on user experience, others on low-level bits of packaging
      systems. </para>
    <para>During these three days, we looked at various bits of technologies, including <ulink
        url="http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/">Debtags</ulink>, the <ulink
        url="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter">Ubuntu Software Center</ulink>, the <ulink
        url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services">Open
        Collaboration Services specification</ulink> and more. This helped us know what is available
      today and where we stand. We quickly agreed that we wanted to share the architecture to
      provide an Application Center for each distribution, even though some distributions might
      choose to have a different set of policies. </para>
    <para>The group worked intensively to define the architecture, from the bottom to the top: this
      includes the definition of a an application metadata format, how to create it and from which
      sources (push as much information as possible upstream!), how to handle user-generated
      metadata, the protocol used to communicate between the distribution server and the Application
      Center client, as well as the user interface. The group is working on properly documenting the
      technical results of this meeting to let the wider community understand the overall
      architecture. Watch the <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHeP2ZBwS_U">video</ulink>
      of a presentation delivered on the last day to Novell people to get an overview of what got
      produced. </para>
    <para>The meeting turned out to be even more productive than originally planned, and all
      participants agreed on a concrete plan with an aggressive time line to push this effort
      forward! Stay tuned! </para>

      application stores on Linux. </para>
    <para>The Bretzn Sprint was dedicated to the development of a proof of concept of this idea,
      using existing components like the <ulink url="http://gitorious.org/meego-garage/">MeeGo

    <para>In just two and a half days, they managed to create a working application store client for
      openSUSE and KDE. The server part was based on <ulink
        url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services">OCS</ulink>
      (Open Collaboration Services), which already did everything needed for the server side and
      just needed some data inserted to be shown in the client. The client in turn was created by
      using the MeeGo Garage client, and adapting it to be a more KDE-like application, by using the
      various KDE widgets and other tools, removing the duplication of functionality which was
      covered by the KDE libraries. </para>
    <para>Finally, a new application view was created, to replace the existing which was never as
      pleasing as the original authors wanted it to be. This was done by using <ulink url="">Qt
        Quick</ulink>, which has allowed for the rapid construction of a much more pleasant look.
      The new interface is the result of a brainstorming session involving all members of the
      sprint, based on the results from the <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/26/app-installer-meeting-or-more-collaboration-accross-borders/"
        >cross-distribution meeting</ulink>. While this work is still in progress, it already
      represents an improvement over the old interface. </para>

      decided to stay with SysV init for 11.4 due to issues in getting the last 10% of the
      integration perfect. </para>
    <para>M6 sees the completed removal of the HAL hardware abstraction layer, to be replaced with
      the more up-to-date and actively maintained udev, udisks and upower suite. HAL was already
      scheduled for removal in 11.3, but it was retained while the last few software packages which
      depend on it were ported to udev and company. </para>
    <para>Branding and artwork has had a lot of attention, with the addition of the final
      wallpapers, splash screens and branding for 11.4. The default wallpaper is called Celadon

      was published, the discussion was leaning towards taking a Firefox 4 beta and online-updating
      it to the final release when it becomes available. </para>

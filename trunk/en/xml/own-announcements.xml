        openSUSE</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>One of the most important activities during software development is testing. In FOSS
      community, software often gets tested by the developers themselves, other developers and
      volunteers. During the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1">openSUSE 12.1</ulink>
      development process it has been important to keep <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory">Factory</ulink> working properly. Testing this
      is however a rather boring, repetitive task: the tester has to boot up a Factory ISO as often
      as possible and check if the basic applications start up and work. We don’t like boring tasks
      so the openSUSE Project has been using the automated testing framework <ulink
        url="http://openqa.opensuse.org">openQA</ulink> to test this release daily!</para>
    <para>This article explains how <emphasis role="bold">openQA</emphasis> works and how you can
      help keep Factory working! We’ll also give some links to more information about testing to
      help new testers learn the trade but also give experienced testers some new tips and insights!

        talk with Michael Miller</ulink></title>
    <para>Friday 16.09, while working on the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1"
        >openSUSE 12.1</ulink> marketing actions during the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:12.1_Marketing_Hackfest">Marketing Hackfest</ulink>,
      two of us had the spontaneous idea to suggest an interview to Michael Miller(<ulink
        url="http://www.suse.com/company/executive-management/">Vice President of Global Alliances
        &amp; Marketing for SUSE</ulink>), asking him a few questions we could have in the openSUSE
      community. We did not have the time to go around, to find the FAQ or to choose the “best
      questions”. It was kind of “shall we do that, around a cup of coffee ? Why not ?”. And Michael
      Miller accepted our proposition, without any objection or any “joker’s need”. (...)</para>

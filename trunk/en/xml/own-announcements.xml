    </title>
    <para>Seasons Greetings to everyone in the openSUSE Community and beyond from the openSUSE
      Board! </para>
    <para>As we come to the end of 2010, we’d like to take a moment to reflect on a banner year in
      the Project. We’ve had some very good progress this year and 2011 promises to be an even
      greater year. This year, we hosted our second annual openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg, Germany
      with over 70 presentations and many BoF discussions. Attendance grew from the first year. </para>
    <para>Also, this year, the Board rolled up its sleeves and opened up a discussion with the
      Community about the strategic direction of openSUSE. A finalized strategic statement is
      imminent. The creation of an openSUSE Foundation is well underway. We’re currently reviewing
      legal documents related to the creation and are very excited about this. The Foundation will
      be a step forward in further empowering our Community. More and more people are stepping up to
      champion openSUSE’s role in the open source world. We saw ambassador growth in countries like
      Brasil and Greece, and stengthened in other places like India, Europe and the United States.
      We’re seeing more people available to show up at conferences and events to present and
      demonstrate openSUSE. </para>
    <para>In addition to releasing openSUSE 11.3, the openSUSE Build Service also reached a critical
      milestone earlier this year with the release of 2.0. A gem of our Project, the Build Service
      aims to not only make package management easier for our own distro but to also make it easier
      with other distros. Truly an open project. Community days abounded all over the place
      throughout the year from Collaboration days to bug/hacking days as teams set aside time to
      complete tasks and move forward with their plans. The openSUSE Board will be holding its final
      meeting of 2010 this Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #opensuse-project IRC channel on Freenode.
      We invite you all to attend, as all of our meetings our public and we do appreciate the many
      contributions our Community offers during our meetings, particularly during the “Where can we
      improve?” session we implemented earlier this year. Incidentally, it is election season again
      for the openSUSE Board and we’re excited to see so many candidates. If you’ve been thinking
      about running for one of the two seats, we encourage you to apply for candidacy ASAP! </para>
    <para>To be sure, serving on the Board is a rewarding experience, and also requires commitment
      and dedication. 2011 is going to be a turning point year for the Project. With the creation of
      the Foundation and implementation of the openSUSE Strategy, there is no doubt that many new
      initiatives from the Community will come forth and the Board will play an important role in
      guiding and shaping the future of openSUSE as a Project. </para>
    <para>So, as we close here, we’d like to wish each and every one of you a safe and joyous
      holiday season with friends and loved ones. You can be sure that as we Board members toast in
      the New Year from various corners of the world, we’ll be thinking of you all and rejoicing
      being part of a strong, dedicated and passionate community. </para>
    <para>See you all at Wednesday’s meeting, and in 2011! </para>

    <para>As you know, Michael Loeffler has left the openSUSE Board to pursue new opportunities, we
      are sad to see him go and wish him well. With his departure and with the upcoming Board
      elections, we have a desire to see a new Chairperson selected. The election rules state that
      the Chairperson be appointed by Novell and yesterday Markus Rex, General Manager of Novells
      Open Platform Solutions, presented Alan Clark to us as the new Chairperson. </para>
    <para>As you may be aware, we have focused a significant amount of our time on the creation of
      an openSUSE Foundation to be independent and to be able to collect and spread funds. And
      Novell has been very supportive with our desire to see this come to fruition. Markus told us
      that one of the reasons he selected Alan is that he has a lot of expertise in setting up
      foundations. Alan helped to form the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) and the Linux
      Foundation, as well as several other open source projects and organisations. We, along with
      Markus, believe that Alan’s experience and expertise will be an asset of immense value to the
      Board, and we welcome that as we, and Novell, partner together in forging ahead on an exciting
      and promising future for the openSUSE Project. </para>
    <para>Alan has already been working with us on the foundation work, but most of you probably
      don’t know him, so we asked Alan to introduce himself: </para>
    <para>Having the opportunity to work closely with the openSUSE community is an exciting
      endeavour. My work assignments over the past few years have enabled me to work directly with
      members of the community. By attending the recent openSUSE conference I was able to make many
      more friends and acquaintances. As always it was a great experience. One of my personal goals
      from this role will be to get to know and to work with as many members of the community as
      possible. </para>
    <para>A bit about me: Though my engineering roles have varied throughout the years, I am a
      software developer at heart. I began my career writing Unix based network protocols. Anybody
      remember LAT? My past projects have helped me develop a broad technical base across the
      spectrum of software development, from device drivers, to file systems, to network protocols,
      to identity and security, to developer SDKs and across multiple operating systems. I remember
      that the first day I was able to do my work on Linux was a great day. </para>
    <para>I am extremely optimistic for the future of openSUSE, the potential growth of the
      community, delivery of the openSUSE strategy and the advancement of Linux in general. Our
      community has a great future! My goal is to help facilitate the many ambitions of the openSUSE
      community members and advance the openSUSE Guiding Principles.</para>
    <para>Please join us in welcoming Alan to his new role! Alan will begin his position at the next
      openSUSE Board meeting tomorrow at 19:00 UTC in the #opensuse-project channel on the Freenode
      network. All of our meetings are open to the public and we welcome you to our meeting to meet
      Alan.</para>

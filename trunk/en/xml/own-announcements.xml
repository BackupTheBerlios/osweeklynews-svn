        >openSUSE 11.4 still going strong</ulink></title>
    <para>A bit over one week ago, <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/"
        >we released openSUSE 11.4</ulink> introducing <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights">many exciting new features</ulink>. The
      result was, as we wrote on Friday: <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/12/opensuse-11-4-made-a-splash/">a big splash</ulink>.
      The 100.000 downloads in the first 24 hours and large numbers of blogs, articles and reviews
      all over the world were certainly impressive! So today we have a look at how the stats looked
      after one week. Did we keep the momentum going?</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">On the numbers</emphasis></para>
    <para>6 days after our previous report, downloads on bittorrent moved to well over 36.000
      downloads from the 12.000 in the first 24 hours. Still over 900 people are seeding. Meanwhile,
      the total number of downloads on <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/114/en">the download
        page</ulink> has exceeded the 300.000 downloads now. Breaking the numbers down a little, we
      can see what images you are choosing. With over 113.000 downloads, the i586 DVD iso is the
      most popular, followed by 83.000 downloads for the 64 bit DVD. The live CD’s are going fast as
      well, with over 37.000 for the KDE (32 &amp; 64 bit) and 31.000 for the GNOME one. Quite a few
      users are even opting for the networked installation CDs, with about 16.000 downloads as
      well.</para>

      openSUSE 11.4 in 24 hours. Well, since then, thousands more have been made! On the release
      day, traffic to the SUSE Studio website spiked by 62%. Right now, SUSE Studio image building
      still takes significantly longer than usual due to the continued increase in traffic… They
      also let us know that it is now possible to automatically update your <ulink

    <para>Among the many creative approaches to launch celebrations perhaps the Geekiest was the

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reviews and articles</emphasis></para>
    <para>There are many more reviews now on the web. We have not spend much time updating <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press">our in-the-press page</ulink> as there is just too
      much. Just in Spain, for example, 10 major sites published reviews and notices – that is not
      including blogs and many smaller sites…</para>
    <para>We do want to point to one particular review, the one by <ulink
        url="http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/?p=6068">The Linux Action</ulink> show. Both
      gentlemen doing this are usually not huge openSUSE fans so we greatly appreciate their glowing
      review of 11.4! And, gents, count on us taking care of the thing you were missing: innovation
      and fancy stuff! There are several great initiatives upcoming as we <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/03/opensuse-finished-2010-big/">reported in this

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Social media stats</emphasis></para>
    <para>Our Social Media guru Chuck ‘pup’ Payne reports some fantastic participation on our
      various social networking channels. The top five countries participating in our social pages
      were the USA, Indonesia (who have created their own page!), Germany, India, and Italy.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Change Your Profile Pix</emphasis></para>
    <para>As a ‘last moment idea’, Chuck posted on the openSUSE page and group that users might like
      to change their pix to the Geeko character that Carlos had had created. A fun way to celebrate
      and promote the release. This was very successful, with 20% of users changing their profile
      pictures to our geeky, suit-wearing lizard!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">openSUSE Facebook Page</emphasis></para>
    <para>The stats for the <ulink

    <para>We started mainly twitting and re-tweeting or news. Chuck sent direct tweets to Linux
      Magazine, Linux Pro Magazine, Linux Journal, which helped because they return retweeted and
      then created they own tweets with links to they websites. We really appreciated the support
      from the media!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Conclusion</emphasis></para>
    <para>Social and more traditional media was buzzing with openSUSE activity since the release. We
      had hundreds of thousands of users downloading the latest openSUSE. We had parties around the
      world (and more coming up). OpenSUSE 11.4 got a lot of attention!</para>

      openSUSE development. While the number of slots is not decided yet, it is now time for you,
      potential students and mentors, to start fleshing out those ideas and talk to each
      other!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">What’s next?</emphasis></para>
    <para>Already the#opensuse-project IRC channel (on Freenode) is buzzing with activity. Students
      and mentors are discussing the proposals – and that is exactly what is needed.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Timeline</emphasis></para>

      opens. Yes, that is next week! Students have until <emphasis role="italic">April
        8th</emphasis> to send in a formal proposal after which the openSUSE GSOC team will review
      the applications. Then Google will make the final decisions which will be published on the

        site</ulink> on <emphasis role="italic">April 25th</emphasis>. Mentors should start <ulink

        now</ulink>, and work with their potential students to create good proposals!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Students</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you want to be a student and work on and within openSUSE for this Google Summer of
      Code, you need to start working on your proposal right away. First up, you should subscribe to
      the opensuse-project mailinglist. Introduce yourself, and let people know that you are looking
      for a mentor. If you are keen to dive right in, our development list is
      opensuse-factory.</para>
    <para>Next up, that proposal. You might be inspired by something from the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011_Ideas">openSUSE GSOC 2011 ideas page</ulink>.
      There is a list of project suggestions with a variety of abilitities and skill sets including
      web programming, Python, Perl and Ruby on Rails. Alternatively, suggest and idea of your
      own!</para>
    <para>Once you have your idea, start to write! Contact the openSUSE team working in the area
      you’d like to work on and see if it is something they are interested in. Try to find a mentor,
      get feedback on your idea and find out if it is doable. In case you based your proposal on an
      idea from the idea page, contact the mentor (if there is one already) on IRC or by mail. If
      you have more generic questions you can always ask on the <ulink
        url="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-project">#opensuse-project</ulink> channel on the
        <ulink url="http://freenode.net/">Freenode servers</ulink> or mail the opensuse-project
      mailing list.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Mentors</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you are willing to mentor a student for GSoC 2011 for openSUSE, you should start with
        <ulink url="mailto:gsoc-mentors+subscribe@opensuse.org">subscribing to the gsoc-mentors
        mailinglist</ulink>. It’s also a good idea to keep an eye on the project mailing list and
      IRC channels for students needing mentors. Next up is <ulink
        url="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/apply_mentor/google/gsoc2011">registering as a
        mentor</ulink> on the Google website and contact our admin <ulink

      the GSoC mailinglist please!</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Time to get started</emphasis></para>
    <para>So, gear up, friends. It is time for a Summer of writing great Code for openSUSE. Talk to
      each other, ask questions, don’t be shy – and remember, there are no stupid questions, only
      stupid answers! If you are unsure if you are able to do do it, please come talk to us in the
        <ulink url="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-project">#opensuse-project</ulink> channel on
      the <ulink url="http://freenode.net/">Freenode servers</ulink>. Everyone has to start
      somewhere, and if it turns out you’re not experienced enough yet or we don’t have a slot for
      you there is no problem. We can still mentor you, help you out with setting up your
      development tools, answer your coding or packaging questions and teach you the ropes of
      working in a Free Software community. So you can’t lose – either way, you can be involved in
      openSUSE, learn valuable skills and have some fun!</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/26/opensuse-renames-obs/">openSUSE renames
        OBS</ulink></title>
    <para>The openSUSE Build Service Team has decided to rename its cutting-edge packaging- and
      distribution build technology to Open Build Service. The new name, while maintaining the
      well-known OBS acronym, signals its open and cross-distribution nature.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The history</emphasis></para>
    <para>The openSUSE Buildservice started out as an internal SUSE technology. In 2006 it was
      decided to open its source code and development process. From that point on, the scope of the
      openSUSE Build Service started to widen. First, it was just there to build add-on packages for
      SUSE Linux. Later on it became able to build openSUSE itself and to support also non-SUSE
      distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, MeeGo and others) and packaging systems (rpm, debian, kiwi),
      now expanded to 21 build targets on 6 architectures. We will support even more systems in
      future, non-Linux targets and also more specialized Linux targets like maintenance channels.
      But while ‘OBS’ is meant for a much wider audience than openSUSE, being used by projects and
      companies like VLC, MeeGo, Dell and many others, its name misleadingly signaled a
      distribution-specific purpose.</para>
    <para>OBS is a unique piece of technology and certainly deserves to be known and used by a wide
      audience. With features like integration with Source Code Management systems including GIT and
      Subversion and powerful collaborative features has made the public instance on <ulink
        url="http://build.opensuse.org">build.opensuse.org</ulink> the preferred build technology
      for well over 27,000 users.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Communication</emphasis></para>
    <para>In highlighting the benefits of OBS to the masses, the over-reaching assumption that the
      service is openSUSE-specfic proved to be a deterrent. It clearly takes additional effort to
      convince a potential user that despite the name, openSUSE Build Service was not <emphasis
        role="italic">just</emphasis> for openSUSE. And the distribution-independent technological
      benefits became lost in the confusion. This effect is very apparent in face to face
      communication as you’ll almost immediately hear others saying <quote>No, I’m a Fedora
        packager, this has nothing to do with me. Sorry</quote>. when they hear about OBS. This same
      effect lead to less people reading articles or attending talks on the subject.</para>
    <para>And while this was an undesirable effect for us promoting one of the key features of the
      openSUSE Project, we also recognized this was preventing developers and packagers wanting to
      promote and distribute their software projects from benefiting from a service that would truly
      enable them to achieve that goal.</para>
    <para>As our openSUSE ambassadors around the world have been stepping up our communication and
      promotion around OBS, they have noticed this effect. After some discussion on the
      international marketing mailing list it was agreed to recommend the OBS team to rename their
      technology to Open Build Service. This would retain the OBS acronym and excellent search
      engine position at the slight expense of a weakened link between the openSUSE community, where
      OBS originated, and the Build Service currently lives.</para>
    <para>But it would clearly signal the open and collaborative nature of OBS and allow OBS to
      spread its wings and reach an even wider audience, benefiting all of Free Software. And that
      has always and continues to be the higher goal of the openSUSE Project.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Decicion</emphasis></para>
    <para>So after ample deliberation and discussion with all the major stakeholders, the OBS team
      agreed that it would be beneficial to rename the openSUSE Build Service to <ulink
        url="http://open-build-service.org/">Open Build Service</ulink>. It is and will remain an
      openSUSE project, with significant contributions from SUSE and openSUSE community members as
      well as many others from communities like MeeGo and VLC but also be more clear about its
      cross-distribution, cross-project goals and ambitions.</para>
    <para>The branding part of OBS will be adapted to make it easy for projects deploying their own
      OBS to name their OBS while staying connected with the OBS project. We suggest to name a
      project-specific OBS instance <quote>XXX Open Build Service</quote>, like <quote>VLC Open
        Build Service</quote>. The new domain name for the project will be <ulink
        url="http://open-build-service.org/">openbuildservice.org</ulink>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reaction</emphasis></para>
    <para>Of course, we at openSUSE are very happy with this change. And so are our friends and
      users of OBS!</para>
    <para>Ralph Dehner, CEO at B1 systems notes:</para>
    <para>“In the past B1 Systems has written build environments for the customers by itself. With
      the open Build Service now exists a “standard” which makes it easy to build packages for
      different distributions and architectures.</para>
    <para>This will be also interesting for many other open source projects.”</para>
    <para>“The Linux Foundation views OBS as an important and useful tool for building software for
      Linux,” said Amanda McPherson, vice president of marketing and developer program for the Linux
      Foundation. “As adoption of OBS has increased, it’s a natural step to rename it to reflect its
      open nature and cross-distribution support.”</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Enterprise Support</emphasis></para>
    <para>As OBS has matured and becomes more widespread, SUSE has <ulink
        url="http://www.novell.com/prblogs/?p=3787">decided</ulink> to help organizations who want
      to use and deploy it. SUSE OBS Developer Support brings commercial support options for
      customers and partners that want to run their own instance of the Open Build Service.</para>
    <para>The support offering will be handled via a new OBS Developer Services (DS) program. Under
      this program, customers will receive support for configuration and setup issues as well as the
      ability to get code fixes for bugs that affect them. As part of this program, SUSE is also
      collecting requirements to the OBS software and will input this into the planning process for
      OBS. SUSE will be working with partners to enable and back them to offer implementation and
      consulting services.</para>

        and World IPv6 Day</ulink></title>
    <para>In a little over a week it will be <ulink url="http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/">World
        IPv6 day</ulink>. This day is meant to call attention to the fact that IPv4 addresses have
      run out and the web has to move on to IPv6. openSUSE will be part of this initiative, joining
      the ranks of Google, Yahoo and Facebook in making sure its infrastructure is IPv6 capable on
      June 8th.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">IPv4 and IPv6</emphasis></para>
    <para>An IP address is the ‘address’ of a device connected to the web. Be it a web server,
      smartphone, laptop or printer – if they are on a network, they need an address. Using these
      addresses computers can make sure packets arrive at the right place. The human-readable
      addresses like <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/31/opensuse-and-world-ipv6-day/openbuildservice.org"
        >http://openbuildservice.org</ulink> are translated at your provider to an IP address
      through a name server. Currently, the web runs on ‘IPv4′. IPv4 provides 4 blocks of 3 numbers
      or 32 bits, adding up to a little over 4 billion addresses. With many households having many
      Internet-capable devices these days this is not enough. The successor of IPv4, IPv6, offers
      128 bits (in decimal a 3 with 38 zeroes) and is thus a lot more ready for the future.</para>
    <para>Since the beginning of this year, the <ulink url="http://www.iana.org/numbers/">Internet
        Assigned Numbers Authority</ulink> which hands out IP addresses to providers to assign to
      devices, is out of IPv4 addresses. The Asian/Pacific “RIR” (Regional Internet registries) ran
      out on April 15. Most local providers and the other regional registries still have a small
      pool of unassigned IP numbers. Unfortunately, with the quickly growing number of devices and
      the world population increasing its access to the Internet, especially providers in the
      quickly growing developing countries, the days of the iconic IPv4 numbering system is
      numbered.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Separation of worlds</emphasis></para>
    <para>However, IPv4 and IPv6 offer separate worlds. An IPv4 server can not talk to an IPv6
      client and the other way around. Many users still have IPv4 only routers and modems at home
      and can’t even join the IPv6 world if they wanted to. This is especially true for older
      routers and modems – like those in countries which adopted the web early, like in Europe and
      the US. As most users there already have Internet, the need for new addresses is less dire.
      This has limited the uptake of IPv6 by the web, especially since offering both IPv4 and IPv6
      can result in problems for IPv4 only users. So major providers and users like Facebook and
      Google, Amazon and the many other important sites on the web don’t offer IPv6 connectivity
      yet. Meanwhile, in China, India and other quickly developing countries, things are decidedly
      different. IPv6 will be crucial if China is to connect it’s vast population to the web. If
      everyone in South America wants a smartphone, a netbook and a desktop – IPv4 won’t cut it. So
      there, IPv6 services are quickly coming up.</para>
    <para>We have to take steps to ensure we don’t create a gap between the quickly developing
      countries and the West. This means making sure our infrastructure is ready for IPv6! This is
      what World IPv6 Day is all about. On that day, major websites and providers around the world
      will test out their IPv6 infrastructure and make sure they are available for everyone.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">We’ll be ready</emphasis></para>
    <para>The <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Services_team">openSUSE sysadmin</ulink>
      team is working hard to bring IPv6 services up. They started a few weeks ago and plan to be
      ready on June 8th, the World IPv6 day. On that day, all external servers will be reachable via
      both IPv4 and IPv6. This includes our <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Main_Page"

        >documentation</ulink> and of course <ulink url="http://openbuildservice.org"
      >OBS</ulink>.</para>
    <para>If you want to help out, there are a few things you can do. First of all, you can check
      the <ulink url="http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/participants-dashboard/">participants
        dashboard</ulink> to see how we are doing. Furthermore, you can <ulink
        url="http://test-ipv6.com/">check if you and your provider are IPv6 ready</ulink> and if you
      are, visit our servers and see for yourself!</para>

      comprehensive testing tool which can run tests on every level of the OS, from core
      functionality like the bootloader and booting the kernel up to testing applications like
      Firefox and LibreOffice. It shows the results in a convenient web interface and allows testers
      to see screenshots and even <emphasis role="italic">videos</emphasis> of the issues found.
      openQA is used to run nightly tests of the ‘Factory’ development repository for the upcoming

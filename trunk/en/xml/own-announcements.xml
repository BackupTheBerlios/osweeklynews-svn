    <para>Since the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE
        Conference</ulink> in Nuremberg in October, the openSUSE community has been extremely
      active. New projects announced there have had progress, others have emerged. One example of
      the latter would be <ulink
        url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-11/msg00206.html">Project
        Tumbleweed</ulink>, aiming to create a rolling-release repository for openSUSE. Going in the
      opposite direction is <ulink
        url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-12/msg00004.html">Project
        Evergreen</ulink> – the Evergreen developers want to provide longer-term support for older
      openSUSE releases for a core set of packages. And there is the new Virtualization:Cloud
      project, where a team got together to create a cloud software repository. Finally, we can’t
      forget to mention the new <ulink
        url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/12/29/kick-off-for-gnomeayatana-project/"
        >GNOME:Atayana project</ulink>, bringing Unity to openSUSE! And those are new just since our
      last conference! Read on to learn more about these four projects.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Tumbleweed</emphasis></para>
    <para>Tumbleweed, recently <ulink
        url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-11/msg00206.html">announced by kernel
        hacker and openSUSE contributor Greg Kroah-Hartman</ulink>, is something you could probably
      only pull off realistically in openSUSE. While openSUSE is a fixed-schedule release project
      (with a release every 8 months), we provide newer stable packages for a variety of things on
      the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service">openSUSE Build Service</ulink>
      (OBS). OBS, which we use to build our own distribution but also to provide packages for many
      other distributions, can provide newer packages for older openSUSE versions. And it makes it
      easy: using the <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/">web interface</ulink> or the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC">command-line client</ulink>, our packagers select
      the older versions as build targets and OBS builds each package on a fresh Virtual Machine.
      This ensures ABI compatibility and stability are preserved – thus OBS is perfect for back
      porting. Or forward-porting! This is what project Tumbleweed aims to take advantage of – a new
      project is created on OBS under the name Tumbleweed, and maintainers just say <quote>hey, this
        package is a stable release, it seems to work – good for Tumbleweed</quote>. *click*.
      Done.</para>
    <para>The goal of the Tumbleweed project is to create a ‘rolling release’ version of openSUSE. A
      rolling release distribution (like Arch Linux or Gentoo) always offers the latest stable
      versions of a package as updates so that when a new release of any upstream software surfaces,
      users actually don’t have to do a distribution upgrade. The packages will simply be part of
      the usual updates. You could see openSUSE Factory, our development tree, as a rolling release
      distribution – but there is a crucial difference. Tumbleweed only offers stable packages –
      where Factory often tracks upstream developments like beta and rc releases of the kernel,
      GNOME or other projects. Compared to Factory, Tumbleweed should be more stable and dependable.
      Compared to just sticking with the normal openSUSE updates, Tumbleweed has the advantage that
      your OS is always up to date and new releases of your distro become less interesting – you
      essentially have them when they are released. The potential downside is a slightly larger risk
      of breakage – as all Tumbleweed users update on different schedules, conflicts might arise,
      and Tumbleweed can’t go through the same testing as a normal openSUSE release.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Status</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you want to test out Tumbleweed, just go and add the <ulink
        url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tumbleweed/standard/">Tumbleweed
        Repository</ulink> as a repo to openSUSE 11.3: <ulink
        url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tumbleweed/standard/"
        >http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tumbleweed/standard/</ulink>
    </para>
    <para>Then run:</para>
    <screen>$ zypper dup</screen>
    <para>and enjoy your newly updated kernel, samba, and other packages!</para>
    <para>Tumbleweed aims to use the 11.3 repo above as a testing ground, and provide a full rolling
      release for the openSUSE 11.4 release. It seems many packagers have joined the initiative and
      while some had some concerns, the plan is to simply try this and see how it goes.</para>
    <para>Greg notes: <quote>Tumbleweed is ready for testing by users who are currently running
        openSUSE 11.3 and are comfortable handling updated packages that don’t always upgrade
        properly at times. If you are used to running FACTORY on a machine, running Tumbleweed would
        be very easy right now. Please note that there might be problems with some package upgrades
        at times as we work out the development workflow, but it is usable for a number of
        users.</quote></para>
    <para>Currently, besides Greg, a number of other developers who are maintaining packages in a
      format that is usable by Tumbleweed are involved. This includes Jiri Slaby for the kernel,
      Takashi Iwai for git, the samba team for samba, and lots of other developers who are just
      maintaining and updating their packages like always.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Future of Tumbleweed</emphasis></para>
    <para>The plan plan is to work out the proper development work flow during the time up to the
      11.4 openSUSE release, and once that is out, have Tumbleweed be usable by anyone who wants to
      have the latest stable releases in a rolling fashion. Until the 11.4 release, a number of
      processes have to be figured out:</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Getting involved</emphasis></para>
    <para>The openSUSE-factory mailing list is the best way to get involved, or just email <ulink
        url="mailto:gregkh@suse.de">Greg</ulink> directly if you have any questions or want to help
      out. If you are a package maintainer, please let him know if you want him to add your packages
      to the Tumbleweed repository now by either doing a normal submit request to the
      openSUSE:Tumbleweed repository like is done for FACTORY, or by emailing and letting him know
      what repository and package he should link directly into Tumbleweed, both work flows are
      currently being used quite successfully.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Evergreen</emphasis></para>
    <para>So Tumbleweed is bleeding edge, which is great if you’re a developer or enthusiast who
      wants to keep your system up to date. On the other end of the scale, stability and long term
      support, another project has surfaced in openSUSE over the last weeks: <ulink
        url="http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2010/11/30/community-powered-long-term-support-for-opensuse/"
        >Project Evergreen</ulink>. Project Evergreen is about the opposite of Tumbleweed: take a
      stable release and maintain it with security updates for a longer time than openSUSE usually
      does. At this point, Evergreen is in its infancy and still needs quite a lot of details to be
      sorted out. The first goal would be to <ulink
        url="http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2011/01/03/opensuse-project-evergreen/">support openSUSE
        11.1</ulink> which went out of official support on Januari 1st. The team aims to keep 11.1
      alive as long as possible – something which depends on the number of contributors. A goal
      would be reach a lifetime of 3 years but it’s unclear if that is possible for 11.1 already.
      The team initially wants to concentrate on providing support for the most important components
      like the kernel and other low-level software, mostly server packages as desktop users usually
      prefer more recent software. This will allow system admins who for example do not have
      physical access to their servers to delay the risky upgrade of their OS by another year or
      so.</para>
    <para>Currently the team is investigating what’s needed to take over the full maintenance and
      how to prepare and distribute the updates to the users. The issue is that OBS doesn’t
      currently support the patch creation work flow and so they cannot use the usual procedures and
      techniques to get patches to the users yet. Moreover, this is a difficult and very long-term
      commitment – it is important to have a serious team to be able to pull this off. There is a
      lot of work ahead, so help would be appreciated. Join the <ulink
        url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">Evergreen mailinglist</ulink> if
      you want to get involved!</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Green clouds are forming</emphasis></para>
    <para>In openSUSE a team formed with the goal to set up repo for cloud computing related
      software. One of the first pieces is the Eucalyptus cloud infrastructure and it’s
      dependencies. The vision is to enable openSUSE to be a cloud infrastructure platform that
      allows you to set up your cloud quickly and easily.</para>
    <para>The OBS development project has already been set up under the name <emphasis role="bold"
        >Virtualization:Cloud</emphasis> and can be found <ulink
        url="https://build.opensuse.org/project/packages?project=Virtualization%3ACloud"
        >here</ulink>.</para>
    <para>The Eucalyptus packages releaesd by the Eucalyptus project work just fine with openSUSE.
      However, the packages provided by Eucalyptus, create the problem that the latest version of
      Eucalyptus is only available on the latest version of openSUSE; based on the time of release
      of the latest version of Eucalyptus. Developers Stephen Shaw and Alexandre Duarte Rogoski
      worked on packaging Eucalyptus in OBS with the goal to support a wider range of openSUSE
      versions. About two months ago, Robert Schweikert also got involved. The team worked together
      on varioues issues and the Eucalyptus packages are now ready for general consumption. After
      installing from the Cloud repository, one can get a Eucalyptus cloud up and running following
      the admin guide from the Eucalyptus page.</para>
    <para>The creation of an Appliance build and SUSE Studio integration will take a bit longer.
      Robert is working on some automation and is waiting for a YaST module, to be contributed to
      the effort by the YaST team, for some basic network configuration. He expects that by late
      January this will be finished. After integration and setup work is completed the current KIWI
      documentation found <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Own_Cloud"
        >here</ulink> will be updated to refelect the latest state of the art. Following the update
      of the KIWI example work for Studio support and SUSE Studio template creation is
      planned.</para>
    <para>Robert is also looking at packaging openNebula. One of the openNebula developers recently
      posted to the openSUSE packaging mailing list and expressed interest in seeing it packaged.
      There are plenty of other candidates out there which deserve packaging – if you’re interested
      in helping out, send a message to the openSUSE packaging mailing list or contact one of the
      involved team members (see the <ulink

    </para>
    <para>Last but not least, just 2 days before the year ended, Nelson Marques announced the new
        <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=GNOME:Ayatana"
        >GNOME:Ayatana</ulink> Build Service project. More information is already available on the
        <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_Ayatana">GNOME Ayatana wiki page</ulink>.
      Nelson has been working on patching and packaging the Indicators from Ubuntu’s Unity project
      for openSUSE for a while now and has decided it was time to announce it <ulink
        url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/12/29/kick-off-for-gnomeayatana-project/">more
        publicly</ulink> (worth a read!). </para>
    <para>Nelson: <quote><emphasis role="italic">The main goal is to provide openSUSE users a
          broader choice in Desktop software. In this case, to provide the software developed by
          Canonical’s Ayatana Project (et all). openSUSE users will benefit of this software
          (partially or fully enabled) without the need of changing their platform. In my humble
          opinion this is the role of a distribution, to <emphasis role="bold">distribute</emphasis>
          Free Software!</emphasis></quote></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Ubuntu patches going to GNOME </emphasis></para>
    <para>For a full functional implementation of Ayatana software packages it is required to patch
      other applications and libraries (from infrastructure like gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf to applications
      like empathy, evolution, etc). So far many of these patches have been submited upstream by
      Ubuntu contributors, some have not. Honoring the openSUSE tradition of working with upstream,
      Vincent Untz and Dominique “Dimstar” Leuenberger, two of the main GNOME maintainers in
      openSUSE are pushing to get them all submitted, accepted and integrated in GNOME. Vincent
      noted: “Upstream should be always more feature rich”. </para>
    <para>Meanwhile, Novell’s Banshee multimedia player (which will be Ubuntu’s default player in
      their next release) offers excellent integration with the new Indicators as you can see on the
      screenshot, after enabling a single extension available in the Banshee Community Extensions
      package.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Availability </emphasis></para>
    <para>The GNOME:Ayatana packages will be available officially starting from the openSUSE 11.4
      release in March. According to Marques: <quote>11.4 will be an awesome distribution and the
        last and greatest GNOME2 release of all time. I would like to offer the latest versions of
        the Ayatana packages whenever possible. I want to encourage openSUSE users to move to 11.4
        and drive the best GNOME2 platform with a wider choice of desktop packages to meet their
        needs. It’s a huge task, even backed up by the awesome experience and know-how of the
        openSUSE GNOME team, there’s not enough time to provide a release for older openSUSE
        versions with the same quality. If any openSUSE contributor wants to take on the task of
        backporting the repository to older releases, I’ll be available to help as much as my free
        time allows. Nevertheless, with the release of GNOME3 much will change, and I believe most
        users will swap to GNOME3 when it becomes available due to the major improvements present.
        With the best GNOME2 implementation, the availability of GNOME3 in the near future (thanks
        to either Tumbleweed or GNOME OBS repositories!) and a wider choice of desktop software, I
        have no doubts 11.4 will be the coolest openSUSE release ever!</quote></para>

        the full extents of the functionality on these indicators, I hope I get some feedback from
        our users to see if I can enable all the possible features without deviating too much from
        upstream. I have no plans or interest in making any of these packages default on GNOME,
        however and I would always oppose such action. openSUSE offers one of the strongest and most
        solid GNOME implementations (for which we have to thank the GNOME Team), I would like to
        keep it that way. GNOME upstream is my choice for Desktop computing needs.</quote></para>

      openSUSE Unity spin in <ulink url="http://www.susestudio.com">SUSE Studio</ulink>. Like
      openSUSE did with shipping Smeegol well before MeeGo 1.0 got released, this way users can test

        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/06/putting-our-accessibility-heads-together-2/"
        >Putting our Accessibility Heads Together</ulink></title>
    <para>Accessibility has become an important selling point in getting computing solutions into
      many organizations. Organizations are faced with legislations and regulations that require
      their environments be accessible and they take it into account when looking for a solution
      that fits their needs. For government organizations, software that doesn’t live up to certain
      accessibility standards is simply not an option. </para>
    <para>Let’s just be frank here. While the openSUSE community cares about accessibility as much
      as anyone else does in FOSS, we haven’t done that well in delivering the best accessible
      solution. There are various people who look at the situation in their own corners and try to
      make the best of it. Andrew Wafaa highlighted some of the challenges in two recent articles. </para>
    <para>Meanwhile openSUSE presents a very unique advantage that hasn’t been leveraged yet. With
      DBUS, the GNOME and KDE communities have worked together to leverage GNOME’s long-standing
      applications to work well on KDE. As openSUSE is a major distribution that provides support
      equally to GNOME and KDE, we have a distinct opportunity to provide the best integration of
      KDE and GNOME with accessibility. Thus offering prospective users and organizations a real
      choice on a distro that is known for its stability and support.</para>
    <para>So what’s the problem? </para>
    <para>Well, its a variety of things. And most certainly not because no one cares.</para>
    <para>While other distributions have formal accessibility teams, we don’t. And we don’t advocate
      for that. After all, one has to realize that a11y doesn’t mean accessibility for people with
      special needs. It means accessibility for all regardless of what your needs are. And that
      means that accessibility issues should be raised in mainstream conversations, not segregated
      off to some corner where no one else knows what’s going on. Therefore, if there’s a problem in
      openSUSE-GNOME accessibility, it should be discussed on that team’s thread. If there’s a
      problem with the installer, it should be discussed on the Factory mailing list, and so on.
      While, philosophically, we still believe in this, in practice, it hasn’t been a perfect world.
      We ended up being like a bunch of loose chickens running around without any real concerted
      effort. And this is a shame because over the years, we’ve had many great accessibility experts
      both in the community and on staff at Novell.</para>
    <para>So what’s the solution? </para>
    <para>Put our heads together! </para>
    <para>At this point in time, we still aren’t going to put together a formal mailing list and
      such, but we do have an #opensuse-a11y channel that has recently begun to grow in population.
      Its a place where we all can kind of chat and keep tabs with each other about what’s going on
      while still focusing on our primary areas of work around the Project. </para>
    <para>On Thursday, 13 January 2011, at 17:00 UTC, we’re going to have a meeting. We’re not going
      to use a formal agenda at this time but rather more like a kvetching where we’ll talk about
      our views of what we see as the obstacles. From there, we hope to have a better and bigger
      picture and develop an idea of how we can go forth collectively and individually in our
      accessibility work. </para>
    <para>If you’ve had some interest in accessibility and have some thoughts or want to learn what
      others are saying, we invite you to join us. We’ll be giving out free virtual coffee and hot
      chocolate throughout the meeting. :-)</para>

    <para>Evergreen needs you! To make a version for 11.2 also released and to guarantee the quality
      of evergreen, we're searching developers, packagers and also marketing people who are
      interested in creating a LTS-version of your favourite Linux-distro, openSUSE.</para>

        Updates</ulink></title>
    <para>We had way too many server downtimes during the last month in our infrastructure. These
      were caused by an unreliable login proxy. We have now developed and setup a new login proxy
      and use it for the following sites:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>build.opensuse.org</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>api.opensuse.org</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>hermes.opensuse.org</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>notify.opensuse.org</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>features.opensuse.org</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>We hope that this new proxy is working reliably now.ý The new proxy is open source and
      source code can be found <ulink
        url="https://www.gitorious.org/opensuse/apache-mod_auth_memcookie">on gitorious.org</ulink>.
      A future version of the openSUSE Build Service (OBS) (not 2.3) will come with this proxy as
      authentication mechanism as well.</para>
    <para>For the openSUSE Build Service, another change is that we switched to apache and the
      passenger module on our productive system, following the new default of OBS 2.3. This should
      also fix some cases of invalid http answers.</para>
    <para>In short, we have changed some key parts of our infrastructure and introduced a new login
      proxy, so there might still be some pitfalls. But we have it under our control now and can
      debug and even fix any issue with it. In case of problems, please speak up on the
      opensuse-buildservice mailing list.</para>

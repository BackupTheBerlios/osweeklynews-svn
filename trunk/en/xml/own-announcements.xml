    <para>The openSUSE conference team adopted the UNIX acronym <emphasis role="bold"
      >RWX</emphasis> for this year’s conference. The goal with this theme is to emphasize the
      stronger focus on getting-things-done and hands-on sessions. So, what sessions are we talking
      about? In this article we’ll dive into one type of interactive session: the <ulink
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)">BoF</ulink>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Definition</emphasis></para>
    <para>Wikipedia <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)"
        >defines</ulink> a BoF as ‘an informal discussion group’, ‘often formed in an ad-hoc
      manner’. It also describes a BoF as ‘an informal meet-up at conferences, where the attendees
      group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned
      agenda’.</para>
    <para>The central concepts are informal, shared interests and ad-hoc. What is not mentioned are
      goals, the why of such a session. But based on the concepts, you can get an idea. The informal
      factor means everyone is equal and can and should voice their opinions. The shared interests
      mean you get together people who care about a particular subject. The ad-hoc factor merely
      re-inforces the other two. A BoF is very much like meeting for dinner: you talk as friends
      about whatever interests you! That is not to say a BoF can’t have goals. Often, BoFs have a
      number of things the participants want to discuss. The person organizing the BoF is usually
      the person who puts one or more topics forward, but everyone is free to bring up other issues.
      This is central to the concept of a BoF – discuss things.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Why?</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2363/2311306708_5a29c44a0b_m.jpg"
      /></para>
    <para>Free Software communities work online in a collaborative fashion. That’s marketing speak
      for: we work together, alone. While each of us sits behind his computer, either alone or with
      others in an office, we form one team. We communicate over mail, IRC and other online
      channels.</para>
    <para>For asking questions, basic decision making or just getting work done, this is excellent.
      For socializing, it is less optimal, but you’ll still find plenty of social interactions
      especially in IRC channels. It gets much harder however, when complicated issues surface. If
      decisions have to be made about processes or fundamental technical directions, the online
      aspect gets in the way. You quickly run into misunderstandings and while our hacker culture
      compels us to fairly direct (‘rude’) communication, still emotions can run wild.</para>
    <para>At the conference, <emphasis role="bold">Cédric Bosdonnat</emphasis> wants to discuss
      using statistics from the LibreOffice git repositories to show information about contributions
      and contributors. He will first present the way statistics are extracted from the repository
      and then pose the question how to turn these rough statistics into valuable, meaningful
      numbers. How do you relate the lines-of-code added to the complexity of a change? How can one
      decide, from the stats, if someone is a long-term contributor? A core developer?</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">This is where face to face meetings help</emphasis>. Getting to know
      each other over dinner or during a party is a powerful enabler for future online
      communication. But it is also the perfect moment to make those <emphasis role="bold">hard
        decisions!</emphasis> And that is where the BoF comes in.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">How?</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/49/171249238_1421d15dca_m.jpg"
      /></para>
    <para>Discussions about future directions or day to day business like improving a review process
      or working together more efficiently – all things done better in person. In a BoF, a team
      working together on-line meets and discusses these things, face to face, in an open manner.
      Not completely unstructured, mind you, but still very open. The organizer of the BoF is there
      merely to start up the discussion and possibly facilitate it. Facilitate by making sure some
      decisions are actually taken. And recorded!</para>
    <para>A typical BoF starts with a short ‘hi all, thanks for coming’, and if needed an
      introduction of the participants. Then, it is time to find the subjects of the discussion at
      hand. The organizer can coin a few things he or she things need to be discussed and others can
      chime in. From there on, it’s a matter of actually going over the subjects one by one.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Jean-Daniel Dodin</emphasis> is involved with testing in openSUSE.
      At the conference, he wants to have a BoF centered around improving the process of testing
      multimedia applications. Many of these applications don’t work as expected or not at all. How
      can we ensure applications are tested reliably and don’t end up on a user’s desktop just if
      theycompile but only after they are proven to actually work?</para>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">challenge</emphasis> now is to keep the discussion from going in
      all directions – something which is fine at a dinner but not productive at a BoF. Gently
      reminding the team of what the goal of the current topic is is usually sufficient. You all
      share the same goals, after all. The second challenge is to make sure decisions are
      taken and recorded. Creating the typical action list of who does what is the best way to go.
      It might make sense, with a large BoF team, to have one person lead the discussion while
      someone else takes notes.</para>
    <para>Know that the person organizing the BoF does not have to be a ‘team leader’, nor a ‘great
      communicator’! Every attendee is equally responsible for the quality and results of the
      discussion. Organizing the BoF is merely a technical detail – not a huge deal at all, and
      anyone can do it.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Responsibilities and tools</emphasis></para>
    <para>Organizing a BoF is surprisingly simple if the right people turn up. For that, a <emphasis
        role="bold">clear description</emphasis> is usually enough. A title like “Factory review
      process discussion” will most likely attract those involved with review of packages in Factory
      and interested in improving the process. If the review process has had hickups in the last few
      months it is highly unlikely that the discussion won’t be attended or not attract the right
      people. Nor is it likely to not have ‘enough to talk about’. The problem is usually more one
      of getting sidetracked and not actually finishing discussing the topic with a proper todo
      list!</para>
    <para>What do you need to organize a BoF? Almost nothing. Pen and paper (for the todo!) will
      usually suffice. A whiteboard might be nice for more complicated problems like mapping out a
      new API, creating a flow diagram of a process or simply noting down the agreed-upon topics for
      the BoF. Otherwise, just talk! Introduce the topic quickly and ask for opinions will fire it
      off easily.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Scheduling BoF’s</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2797/4537737867_3ebfc19183_m.jpg"
      /></para>
    <para>Usually, BoF’s are scheduled ‘on the spot’ using a big whiteboard in the main hall of the
      conference or on an open wiki page. That can lead to two similar BoF’s or two BoF’s targeting
      the same team at the same time, however. It also means you might not have a spot at a decent
      time. Which might result in being forced to plan a BoF in the time slot of a talk about the
      same subject . This is why the openSUSE CfP team asks you to plan BoF’s in advance!</para>
    <para>The biggest perceived problem with planning a BoF is the inherent contradiction in
      ‘planning’ and ‘BoF’. Yes, you might not know now what will be an issue 3 months from now.
      However, you don’t have to nail the agenda down today, that would indeed run counter to the
      whole concept of a BoF. If you think your team will benefit from having a good, open
      discussion about what you do and how you (want to) do it, simply send in a quick proposal to
      the openSUSE Conference Paper Committee. It is no problem if something more urgent pops up and
      you discuss that instead of following the initial description. The main reason for ‘planning’
      (part of) the BoF’s beforehand is to allow the CfP team to try and schedule things in such a
      way there is little overlap with talks and other BoF’s and to allow teams to reserve a
      room.</para>
    <para>So go to the conference page and add a BoF!</para>

    <para>The ‘cloud’ has been a buzzword for quite a while. While some are still rather cynical
      towards the concept, products like mobile phones with Android have shown the value of putting
      your data in that huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere. Apple recently introduced
      their new cloud service and Microsoft has their cloud too. So with the other major players
      talking cloudy, what does Linux have?</para>

    <para>Let’s define Cloud technology as ‘related to putting data online &amp; sharing among
      devices’ which is a reasonable definition for our purposes. There is a huge number of
      technologies connecting openSUSE users to online services. However there is a distinction to
      be made between commercial or proprietary operating systems and ours. We don’t create a vendor
      lock-in scenario because we focus on tools that freely connect you to your choice of publicly
      available services. This is a key distinction because we’re not owning or controlling the
      cloud that you place your data in. You, the user, get to decide the place where it best fits

    <para><emphasis role="bold">File sharing and syncing services</emphasis></para>
    <para>A file sharing and syncing service helps you keep the files on several computers in sync
      and allows you to share such files with others on the web. This is indeed what Apple recently
      introduced, but others have gone before.</para>
    <para><ulink url="https://spideroak.com/">SpiderOak</ulink> offers such an online space for
      synchronizing files. Just drop the files in a specific folder on your drive and you can share
      them between your computers, mobile devices and even with other people. SpiderOak is included
      in the openSUSE repositories since openSUSE 11.3.</para>
    <para>The popular <ulink url="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</ulink> service offers a similar

    <para>But both services depend on proprietary server components and need a proprietary daemon to
      run on your system. Dropbox also doesn’t encrypt the data on the server, something Spideroak
      at least does. SpiderOak also promised to at some point open source their client software.
      Still, the server side and web interface will remain closed. Luckily there are Free Software
      solutions out there, two of them I’ll talk about here.</para>

      /></para>
    <para><ulink url="http://www.kablink.org/ifolder">iFolder</ulink> is a Free Software file
      storage, backup and sharing solution written in C# and Mono. iFolder comes with a desktop
      client which allows you to manage your iFolders. iFolders can be located on any number of
      servers, each having a number of folders which you can manage independently. Each folder can
      be your own or shared with others and files dropped or modified in them will be synced right
      away. iFolder, like Dropbox and SpiderOak, has clients for Windows, Mac and Linux and new is a
      web interface so you can access your files anywhere and share them with others on-line.</para>
    <para>iFolder does have some powerful capabilities, especially for corporate environments. For
      example, unlike most competing solutions it only transfers modified portions of files instead
      of the whole file, saving you some bandwidth. iFolder also offers integration with LDAP, disk
      quotas, and limits to the number of iFolders each user has. It integrates in the Desktop with
      a Nautilus plugin which allows you to turn any folder into a shared iFolder and iFolder has
      fully encypted file transfer and storage. Finally, a big plus of iFolder is the excellent
      documentation which you can find <ulink url="http://ifolder.com/ifolder/documentation"
        >here</ulink>.</para>
    <para>So unlike Dropbox and SpiderOak, iFolder is fully Free Software and the source is <ulink

        >hosted on sourceforge</ulink> and can be found <ulink
        url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ifolder/">here</ulink>. With 9 commits in the last 2
      months it is not a hugely active project and the last release is from November 2009. Still bug
      fixes are being added and lots of improvements were landed in 2010. You can find more
      up-to-date versions by <ulink

    <para><emphasis role="bold">introducing ownCloud</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic

    <para><ulink url="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</ulink> is an exciting and much more active
      project, developing file synchronization technology on a Free Software base. However, ownCloud
      is far more ambitious as you can read in <ulink
        url="http://blog.karlitschek.de/2011/06/yesterday-apple-announced-their-new.html">this
        recent blogpost</ulink> by lead developer Frank Karlitschek. Frank welcomed Apple to the
      Cloud, giving a feature comparision between ownCloud and their cloud offering. He mentioned
      that:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>Apple finally [has] features which are essential for people who live in a connected
        world and have more than one device</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>Furthermore, after having a look at what Apple came up with, he concludes:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>It seems that we support everything iCloud is doing and a bit more if you look into the
        feature set. And we have a fundamentally more advanced vision and architecture.</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>ownCloud offers all the basics of accessing files via a variety of means including a web
      interface and WebDAV. WebDAV support means integration in both <ulink
        url="http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus">Nautilus</ulink> and <ulink
        url="http://dolphin.kde.org/">Dolphin</ulink>, as well as all KDE and most GNOME
      applications. ownCloud can synchronize application data like Bookmarks and settings and allows
      you to listen to your online music collection in a few ways including from <ulink
        url="http://ampache.org/">Ampache</ulink> and via the web interface. The same goes for
      movies and photo’s while PIM syncing is in the works.</para>
    <para><inlinegraphic
        fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ownCloud_Login-300x173.jpg"
      /></para>
    <para>Above and beyond iCloud, work is going on in ownCloud to offer versioning of all files
      through it’s git backend and the ability to share your files with whomever you want. More
      importantly, ownCloud is extensible. It is possible to write addons to ownCloud like RSS
      readers, todo lists and note syncing or even collaborative gaming. And ownCloud doesn’t limit
      you with DRM or digital fingerprints, allowing you to put your music and movies online without
      restrictions. Finally, where Apple’s cloud just works with Apple devices (as we’ve come to
      expect from them), ownCloud is not so picky, working with Windows, Mac and Linux as well as
      Android, MeeGo and of course the iPhone. This is possible because ownCloud uses open standards
      and works with Free Software where possible, including the mentioned webDav, HTML5, <ulink
        url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services">Open
        Collaboration Services</ulink> and <ulink url="http://ampache.org/">Ampache</ulink>. An
      access library for applications, to offer better integration with ownCloud, is already
      available and part of the latest openSUSE.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Upcoming</emphasis></para>
    <para>And more is <ulink
        url="http://owncloudtest.blogspot.com/2011/06/owncloud-20-just-merged-with.html">coming in
        ownCloud 2.0</ulink>, scheduled for later this year. The UI has been completely redesigned
      and there is now media support to play audio and video via the web interface. The mentioned
      Ampache support, developed by Robin Appelman, will have a nice effect: the awesome <ulink
        url="http://tomahawk-player.org/">Tomahawk music player</ulink> we <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/16/opensuse-and-online-services/">mentioned
        yesterday</ulink> has Ampache support and thus will be able to play music directly from your
      ownCloud 2.0 server!</para>
    <para>Moreover, user management has been improved as well, and you will be able to extend
      ownCloud with new functionality via apps and plugins! Finally, ownCloud aims to support not
      only Chromium and Firefox but also lesser used browsers like Konqueror. A really exciting
      feature is being worked on by a <ulink url="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSOC</ulink> student:
      git versioning of files! There is some UI work to be done, which will then allow you to go
      back in time and see earlier versions of your files.</para>
    <para>Aaron, one of the ownCloud developers, gives <ulink
        url="http://owncloudtest.blogspot.com/2011/06/owncloud-20-just-merged-with.html">his
        thoughts</ulink> on where ownCLoud should go:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>With this, we can not only compete with Apple &amp; Google, we can leave them behind or
        integrate with them from our own camp. There’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to play your
        music from the cloud in Amarok or Tomahawk, view your calendar events on your iPhone and in
        Kontact and access all of your files from Android or webOS or Gnome or Windows or OS X. You
        should also be able to back up your home directory and keep it in sync between multiple
        computers</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Control</emphasis></para>
    <para>The most important feature of ownCloud, however, is control. In Frank’s words:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>You don't have to put your private data into the hosting center of a big company</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>You can install ownCloud on your own server, your desktop at home, a company server but
      also at a hosting provider supporting PHP, or run it as appliance in some cloud service under
      your direct control. Because it is Free Software, you fully own your data and only <emphasis
        role="italic">you</emphasis> can determine what happens with it.</para>
    <para>All this doesn’t have to mean ownCloud is hard to set up. The upcoming 2.0 version will
      make it drastically easier to deploy but the current 1.2 release can also be had in a number
      of very easy ways.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Get ownCloud</emphasis></para>
    <para>You can install owncloud on your own server or even desktop using the <ulink
        url="http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=owncloud&amp;baseproject=ALL">openSUSE
        repositories on OBS</ulink>. Be sure to read <ulink
        url="http://owncloud.org/index.php/Installation#openSUSE">the documentation</ulink> on
      starting and managing your ownCloud. You can also use the how-to on <ulink
        url="http://owncloudtest.blogspot.com/2011/06/getting-your-owncloud.html">Aaron’s
        blog</ulink> to get the latest and freshest version installed from source! After following
      the basic installation steps, you just have to go to <ulink
        url="http://127.0.0.1/owncloud/index.php">127.0.0.1</ulink> in your browser to complete the
      setup from the web interface.</para>
    <para>However, your ownCloud can be had easier. You can use the excellent <ulink
        url="http://susegallery.com/a/TadMax/owncloud-in-a-box">ownCloud-in-a-box SUSE Studio
        image</ulink> to download a virtual image of ownCloud and start running it right away. It
      gets even more interesting with the <ulink url="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic
        Cloud Computing</ulink> support of SUSE Studio. Deploying your image on the Amazon cloud
        <ulink url="http://blog.susestudio.com/2011/05/its-never-been-so-ec2-access-cloud.html">is
        easy as pie</ulink>. You could use <ulink url="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/"
        >microinstance</ulink> for which even a <ulink url="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free 1-year
        subscription</ulink> is available. Yes, that’s right, you can have <emphasis role="italic"
        >your</emphasis> openSUSE ownCloud under <emphasis role="italic">your</emphasis> full
      control on Amazon EC2 for <emphasis role="bold">FREE</emphasis> for one year!</para>
    <para>If running your own Appliance on EC2, another provider or your own hardware is still a tad
      complicated, there is an even easier option: <ulink
        url="https://www.packagecloud.com/?au=owncloud">packagecloud.com</ulink>. They offer
      ownCloud hosting (including a free option, yup) with their convenient web interface. Yes,
      again, full control over your own data and easy to use.</para>

    <para>ownCloud is a Free Software project, which means you can get involved. The team is looking
      for anyone who has some skills in (or wants to learn) PHP, C++, HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript.
      Drop by #owncloud on freenode or send an email to owncloud on kde.org and get involved
      today!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Conclusion</emphasis></para>
    <para>Frank closes his blog with:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>I think ownCloud has the potential to become the cloud storage solution for people who
        donýt like vendor lock-ins and care about freedom and privacy</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>We would like to go a step further and claim that the wide variety of hosting options for
      ownCloud offers not only more security and privacy but also far more flexibility and, in time,
      lower prices than what Google, Apple, Microsoft and the other ‘big boys’ bring to the table.
      Combined with the excellent integration openSUSE desktops already offer with online services,
      openSUSE has a sunny future in the cloud.</para>

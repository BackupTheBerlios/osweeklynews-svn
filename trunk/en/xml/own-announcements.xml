      2011</ulink></title>
    <para>The third openSUSE Conference, <emphasis role="bold">osc11</emphasis>, kicks off on
        <emphasis role="bold">Sunday September 11</emphasis>, 2011 in <emphasis role="bold"
        >Nuremberg, Germany</emphasis>. Under the motto <emphasis role="bold">RWX</emphasis> all
      Free and Open Source Software enthusiasts are invited to come together for four days
        to<emphasis role="bold"> learn</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">hack</emphasis> and to
        <emphasis role="bold">have a lot of fun</emphasis>. The program will cover a variety topics
      with an emphasis on interaction between participants. The conference is <emphasis role="bold"
        >free of charge and open to anyone!</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">OSC – The annual meeting of the community</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/community.png"
        width="50%"/></para>
    <para>The conference is the yearly get-together of the openSUSE community to give its people a
      chance to meet face to face, talk to and inspire each other. Having the chance to chat on the
      hallway, to quickly throw some ideas together on a whiteboard or to watch over each others
      shoulders while hacking can easily substitute endless chat sessions, thousand-mail threads on
      a mailing list and tiresome telephone calls. Being together in one room, even in this day and
      age, beats every other collaboration method and is what forges cohesion and friendships. That
      is why the openSUSE Project tries to get together this conference every year for its
      contributors. But not only for them, the conference is also for anyone using, working with or
      taking advantage of the project. No matter if you use our technology, if you are one of our
      many friends from free and open source upstream projects or if you contribute to another
      GNU/Linux distribution this conference is for you.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Find more information about the conference, the program and the
        location at<ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org"

    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Program – Everybody has to read, write and
      execute</emphasis></para>
    <para>Last year, the conference had the motto <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/?p=5223">‘Collaboration Across Borders’</ulink> and
      brought together an international crowd from many communities. This year we shift our
      attention a bit deeper, aiming for hands-on discussions to get work done. Smaller, more
      focused meetings with a strong “read-write” attitude are at the core of the conference. Hence
      the subtitle of <emphasis role="bold">RWX^3</emphasis>, commonly known as the UNIX acronym for
      “Read, Write, Execute” – three times, for you, your community and the rest of the
      world!</para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/intro.png"
        width="40%"/></para>
    <para>The highlights, like every year, are the keynotes that kick of each day. This year our
      community manager Jos, kernel hacker Greg KH and Michael Miller, marketing vice president of
      SUSE will give the honors. Of course the general program also has a lot of highlights in the
      distribution, community and technology tracks.</para>
    <para>Our distribution is, naturally, one of the topics which receives a lot of focus at our
      conference. Learn from Stefan Seyfried how to run the coolest bleeding edge stuff from the
      development tree while still retaining a reliable system that you can use for daily work. Let
      the Boosters teach you how to leave your own footprints in the distribution by becoming an
      contributor. Or get creative and work with other designers on the artwork for the desktops and
      applications 12.1 then and there.</para>
    <para>Also the “<emphasis role="italic">soft topics</emphasis>” in (Free-) software engineering
      will get their share of attention. Lydia Pintscher gives a workshop to discuss a number of
      topics that often cause social problems in technical communities and Henne Vogelsang
      introduces you to the basics of citizen journalism so you can improve your blogging skills. Or
      how about you help to shape the future of the Ambassador program in a workshop with Kostas
      Koudaras and Manu Gupta?</para>
    <para>Another cluster of topics will evolve around new technology that will bring FOSS and
      openSUSE forward. Robert Schweikert will give you an introduction to the basics of a cloud and
      an overview of the cloud projects in the Open Build Service. Brush up your debugging skills in
      a gdb workshop with Jýrgen Weigert or tag along for the journey of an I/O request through the
      kernel block layer with Suresh Jayaraman.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italic">All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</emphasis>. So how
      about you visit the legen, wait for it…., dary social event on Monday at <ulink

    <para>After two years at the Berufsfýrderungswerk <ulink url="http://www.bfw-nuernberg.de/"/> in
      the outskirts of Nýrnberg, we have found a new location smack in the middle of the city. 10
      minutes away from the center of Nýrnberg, in a former production area of the <emphasis
        role="bold">A</emphasis>llgemeine <emphasis role="bold">E</emphasis>lektricitýts-<emphasis
        role="bold">G</emphasis>esellschaft (<emphasis role="bold">AEG</emphasis>), the conference
      will be hosted by the <ulink url="http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/"><emphasis role="italic"
          >Zentrifuge</emphasis></ulink>. The Zentrifuge is a project that networks cultural
      interested and creative people in the region. The whole location has a special atmosphere of
      an old industrial plant, mixed with art and creativity. The perfect balance between work and
      play which we always aim for at the conference.</para>
    <para>Nýrnberg with a population of 500,000 is the nucleus of the metropolitan region <emphasis
        role="italic">Franconia</emphasis> at the heart of Europe. Located in southern Germany, it
      is midway between Munich and Frankfurt and therefor easily reachable by road, rail and air. As
      a tourist city, known for the Nuremberg Trials and famous for the Christmas Market, Nýrnberg
      has a very good tourist office which will help you with all your needs. The office also
      provides an <ulink
        url="http://tourismus.nuernberg.de/v06/no_cache/en/book-order/hotel-search-booking.html"
        >accommodation portal</ulink> on the web which should be your starting point to find a place
      to stay.</para>

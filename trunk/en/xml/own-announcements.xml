    <para>and so in this last window for bug-fixing we need your help! The <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Testing_meeting">testing team</ulink> is looking for
      volunteers to help with bugs in <ulink url="http://bugzilla.novell.com/">bugzilla</ulink> on
      the Open-Bugs-Day at Sunday the 20th of February. Participants are going through the bugs that
      currently exist for 11.4 in bugzilla, close what is fixed and confirm what still needs some
      work. It’s all part of a final push for a great 11.4 release, with us clearing out what is
      fixed, the developers can focus their energies on fixing bugs instead of clicking around in
      bugzilla! We will meet, hang out and coordinate during the Open-Bugs-Day in the IRC channel
        <ulink url="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-testing">#opensuse-testing</ulink> on the <ulink
        url="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</ulink> network and anyone using openSUSE is welcome to
      help. Read on to learn more about how you can make a difference.</para>

    <para>If you don’t know how to triage bugs the organizers will give you a list of bugs that you
      can work on and you can double-check with other participants that your changes are okay. If

    <title><ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/02/04/new-ssl-certificates/">New SSL
        Certificates</ulink></title>
    <para>We will be updating our certificates for *.opensuse.org and *.suse.de today, sometime
      between 19:00 and 22:00 UTC. We will be upgrading to a 2048 bit certificate, which will
      provide better security for the site. We are also switching to a different vendor who can
      provide us more efficient support. We plan on chaining the certificate up to the Entrust root
      CA. </para>
    <para>It is possible that a small portion of the community may experience some issues with this
      switch. Specifically, any system previous to SUSE 10 may not have the Entrust CA in its system
      certificate store. For these systems, utilities such as wget may present an error when trying
      to pull a resource from opensuse.org over an SSL connection. The solution is to either run
      wget with the “–no-check-certificate” option or to add the Entrust root to the system
      certificate store (found in /etc/ssl/certs). Browsers and cURL use their own certificate store
      and should not be affected by this switch, even on older systems. </para>
    <para>If anyone discovers an issue after we make the switch, please contact
        <email>webmaster@opensuse.org</email>.</para>

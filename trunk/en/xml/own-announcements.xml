        12.1 Launch Feedback</ulink></title>
    <para>openSUSE 12.1 was launched on Wednesday and it’s time to look back at the successful
      launch of a great distribution.</para>
    <para>We’ve seen a lot of positive feedback regarding openSUSE 12.1 via <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press">press</ulink>, social networks, blogs etc. The
      interest in social media is significant with good conversations and new members, our <ulink
        url="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2256834487">facebook group</ulink> has grown the
      last weeks by several hundred new members, the followers of our <ulink
        url="http://twitter.com/#%21/openSUSE">@openSUSE twitter</ulink> increase and the recently
      launched Google+ page is in the circles of over 3200 people. (...)</para>

    <para>Yes, it is almost time. Tomorrow openSUSE 12.1 will be released to the world, bringing a
      large number of new features and cool stuff. We’ll look at a few things today and show you

        >openSUSE participates in Google Code-in</ulink></title>
    <para>Introducing people to the world of free and open source software (FOSS) has always been a
      priority for the openSUSE project. We’re not only doing so for new users with our distribution
      (did you get 12.1 yet?) or for new contributors with our project, we also frequently
      participate in programs like Googles Summer of Code or Code in. Those programs have introduced
      a lot of new contributors to both openSUSE and the FOSS community. So with pride we announce
      that, after a successful participation in Google Summer of Code this year, openSUSE will also
      participate in Google Code-in. (...)</para>

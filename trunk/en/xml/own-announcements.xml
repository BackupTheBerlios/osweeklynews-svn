    <title><ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/31/opensuse-and-world-ipv6-day/">openSUSE
        and World IPv6 Day</ulink></title>
    <para>In a little over a week it will be <ulink url="http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/">World
        IPv6 day</ulink>. This day is meant to call attention to the fact that IPv4 addresses have
      run out and the web has to move on to IPv6. openSUSE will be part of this initiative, joining
      the ranks of Google, Yahoo and Facebook in making sure its infrastructure is IPv6 capable on
      June 8th.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">IPv4 and IPv6</emphasis></para>
    <para>An IP address is the ‘address’ of a device connected to the web. Be it a web server,
      smartphone, laptop or printer – if they are on a network, they need an address. Using these
      addresses computers can make sure packets arrive at the right place. The human-readable
      addresses like <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/31/opensuse-and-world-ipv6-day/openbuildservice.org"
        >http://openbuildservice.org</ulink> are translated at your provider to an IP address
      through a name server. Currently, the web runs on ‘IPv4′. IPv4 provides 4 blocks of 3 numbers
      or 32 bits, adding up to a little over 4 billion addresses. With many households having many
      Internet-capable devices these days this is not enough. The successor of IPv4, IPv6, offers
      128 bits (in decimal a 3 with 38 zeroes) and is thus a lot more ready for the future.</para>
    <para>Since the beginning of this year, the <ulink url="http://www.iana.org/numbers/">Internet
        Assigned Numbers Authority</ulink> which hands out IP addresses to providers to assign to
      devices, is out of IPv4 addresses. The Asian/Pacific “RIR” (Regional Internet registries) ran
      out on April 15. Most local providers and the other regional registries still have a small
      pool of unassigned IP numbers. Unfortunately, with the quickly growing number of devices and
      the world population increasing its access to the Internet, especially providers in the
      quickly growing developing countries, the days of the iconic IPv4 numbering system is
      numbered.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Separation of worlds</emphasis></para>
    <para>However, IPv4 and IPv6 offer separate worlds. An IPv4 server can not talk to an IPv6
      client and the other way around. Many users still have IPv4 only routers and modems at home
      and can’t even join the IPv6 world if they wanted to. This is especially true for older
      routers and modems – like those in countries which adopted the web early, like in Europe and
      the US. As most users there already have Internet, the need for new addresses is less dire.
      This has limited the uptake of IPv6 by the web, especially since offering both IPv4 and IPv6
      can result in problems for IPv4 only users. So major providers and users like Facebook and
      Google, Amazon and the many other important sites on the web don’t offer IPv6 connectivity
      yet. Meanwhile, in China, India and other quickly developing countries, things are decidedly
      different. IPv6 will be crucial if China is to connect it’s vast population to the web. If
      everyone in South America wants a smartphone, a netbook and a desktop – IPv4 won’t cut it. So
      there, IPv6 services are quickly coming up.</para>
    <para>We have to take steps to ensure we don’t create a gap between the quickly developing
      countries and the West. This means making sure our infrastructure is ready for IPv6! This is
      what World IPv6 Day is all about. On that day, major websites and providers around the world
      will test out their IPv6 infrastructure and make sure they are available for everyone.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">We’ll be ready</emphasis></para>
    <para>The <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Services_team">openSUSE sysadmin</ulink>
      team is working hard to bring IPv6 services up. They started a few weeks ago and plan to be
      ready on June 8th, the World IPv6 day. On that day, all external servers will be reachable via
      both IPv4 and IPv6. This includes our <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Main_Page"

        step towards 12.1 with Milestone 1</ulink></title>
    <para>Milestone 1, the first step towards the upcoming openSUSE 12.1 release, is now available.
      It is the first milestone, hence far from stable, but the images are now finally building, so
      we have a good starting point for further development.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Many updates, systemd still optional</emphasis></para>
    <para>With over 800 updates, including minor and major updates, the current milestone is ready
      for some serious testing. This iteration already sees some major upgrades taking place, with
      the kernel moving on to 2.6.39 and GNOME to 3.0. In addition we have popular GNOME
      applications like Evolution, Eye of GNOME and others all synchronized, and KDE’s Plasma
      Desktop coming along nicely with a minor version upgrade to 4.6.3. You will also find upgrades
      to GCC, glibc, Perl, Python, and the RPM package manager. Much work has also been put into the
      much-lauded systemd which has now been upgraded to version 26.</para>

    <para>The openSUSE Conference 2011 has been announced and already we’re getting some strong
      proposals for topics to cover during our conference.  It’s not too late for you to send in
      your proposal or even suggest ideas that others can take on!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Goal of the Conference</emphasis></para>
    <para>The RWX3 theme says it all..  Its about collaboration.  Its about you.  And its about what
      we, as a Project, can do for ourselves and for the world.That means we are *NOT* going to be
      sitting around for four days listening to folks drone all day long while we stare at slide
      presentations.  It means we all get to roll up our sleeves and jump right into it.  Sure there
      will be some ‘slide presentation’ sessions (and you can bet we’re going to have some great
      ones) but the focus will be on hands on and plenty of <ulink
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)">BoF (Birds of a
        Feather)</ulink> sessions where we can all make a direct contribution to the things that
      impact the Project and FOSS.And speaking of FOSS, as always, not everything we do is only to
      benefit openSUSE Project. The Project itself has a strong goal of creating and supporting
      initiatives that have a much wider scope.  So, if you’ve got a great software or community
      project you’ve been working on and need the backing of a larger community of contributors,
      this is the conference you want to bring your initiative to!</para>

        >Get your fresh kernels from openSUSE and test Linux 3.0!</ulink></title>
    <para>The openSUSE kernel developers have recently announced that the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Kernel">kernel</ulink> git trees have moved to <ulink
        url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/git">kernel.opensuse.org/git</ulink>, providing better
      reliability than gitorious. Gitorious had trouble with cloning the nearly 1GB repository
      sometimes, but the developers will keep syncing to gitorious so nothing should break.
      Moreover, <ulink url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/">kernel.opensuse.org</ulink> offers an easy
      interface to install openSUSE kernels on a variety of openSUSE releases.</para>
    <para>More things are planned for kernel.opensuse.org including the introduction <ulink
        url="http://lxr.linux.no/">LXR</ulink>. <ulink url="http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/about/"
        >cgit</ulink> was already added during the writing of this article!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">What is there – daily fresh kernels!</emphasis></para>
    <para><ulink url="http://kernel.opensuse.org">kernel.opensuse.org</ulink> offers an interface
      for users to find a specific version of a kernel for openSUSE. As <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Kernel">the wiki</ulink> states, there is a number of different
      kernels build for openSUSE. This includes the default kernel (usable for desktops and
      real-hardware servers), the desktop kernel, optimized for desktop usage and a number of more
      specialized kernels including Xen and EC2 ready kernels, debug, trace and of course a vanilla
      (standard kernel.org) kernel. On kernel.opensuse.org you can find (links to) repositories for
      all current openSUSE and SLE releases with up to date versions of all the mentioned kernels
      and more. Most of these are build daily to keep ‘em fresh!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Follow upstream</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you want to follow upstream kernel development closely, <ulink
        url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/branches/vanilla">vanilla</ulink> is probably your thing.
      This will turn into the upcoming <emphasis role="bold">Linux 3.0 kernel</emphasis>! If you
      feel adventurous and want to test patches that are not yet ready to go in the mainline kernel,
      check the <ulink url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/branches/linux-next">linux-next
        branch</ulink>. These are patches which will go into ‘Linux 3.1′, the upcoming+1 version of
      the Linux kernel.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Or track openSUSE</emphasis></para>
    <para>Or, you might want to test what is coming in the next openSUSE release via the <ulink
        url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/branches/master">‘master branch’</ulink>. This will give you
      a kernel that is ahead even of the Factory kernel! Each of those kernels is build for a large
      number of build targets including openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and a number of SLE versions.
      Clicking on Packages (under the Tools menu top-right) and then the kernel branch you like (the
      kernel from openSUSE 11.4, SLES10_SP3, linus’ git tree ‘vanilla’, etc) will show you the
      repository and how to add it. These kernels are build daily, so tracking what the kernel
      developers are up to is easy as pie!</para>
    <para>Michal Marek, working on kernel.opensuse.org told us that:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>master, openSUSE-11.3, openSUSE-11.4, vanilla, stable and linux-next should work on any
        of 11.3, 11.4 and Factory. I fixed the spec files now so that the packages also install on
        11.2, but that release is out of support, anyway.</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">How to use it</emphasis></para>
    <para>To add a specific kernel to openSUSE, click on the branch you are looking for and then on
        <emphasis role="italic">packages</emphasis> under the Tools menu. You will then see the
      zypper command which will help you add this kernel to your openSUSE installation.</para>
    <para>By default, the kernel will replace your old kernel. If you want to be keep the old one as
      a fallback, go to /etc/zypp/zypp.conf and uncomment the line starting with "multiversion =".
      For the vanilla and linux-next branches, this is not needed, the default configuration puts
      Linus’ kernel-vanilla next to your default kernel-desktop in parallel. Having the kernel
      available as option the boot menu and not replacing your current kernel protects you from
      issues with the latest piece of technology you are testing out!</para>

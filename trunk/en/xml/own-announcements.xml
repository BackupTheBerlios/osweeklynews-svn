        Will you Party?</ulink></title>
    <para>A little over two weeks left for openSUSE 12.1 to be released on November, 16th 2011. And
      there is no better way to enjoy the new release than with your fellow openSUSE peers. So,
      attend or organize a Launch Party! These events around the openSUES release can be anything –
      from a party in a pub to a series of presentations at an office. But there is a common theme:
      cool people sharing some fun and talks around the latest openSUSE release!</para>
    <para>Read more on how to find out if there is a release party in your neighborhood or how to
      organize one! (...)</para>

    <para>One of the most important activities during software development is testing. In FOSS
      community, software often gets tested by the developers themselves, other developers and
      volunteers. During the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1">openSUSE 12.1</ulink>
      development process it has been important to keep <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory">Factory</ulink> working properly. Testing this
      is however a rather boring, repetitive task: the tester has to boot up a Factory ISO as often
      as possible and check if the basic applications start up and work. We don’t like boring tasks
      so the openSUSE Project has been using the automated testing framework <ulink
        url="http://openqa.opensuse.org">openQA</ulink> to test this release daily!</para>
    <para>This article explains how <emphasis role="bold">openQA</emphasis> works and how you can
      help keep Factory working! We’ll also give some links to more information about testing to
      help new testers learn the trade but also give experienced testers some new tips and insights!

    <para>Evergreen needs you! To make a version for 11.2 also released and to guarantee the quality
      of evergreen, weýre searching developers, packagers and also marketing people who are
      interested in creating a LTS-version of your favourite Linux-distro, openSUSE.</para>

        >openSUSE servers with one click</ulink></title>
    <para>Everybody knows openSUSE offers a great desktop experience; but its also a perfect fit for
      servers! ýGo download the <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/114/en">Installation
        DVD</ulink> (or use one of the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Buy_openSUSE">manufactured
        DVD</ulink>s) and we’ll see how easy YaST makes it to setup a variety of specialized
      servers.</para>
    <para>During the course of a normal installation, the opportunity to add servers is slightly
      hidden. The last step before an actual installation is the Installation Overview. ýAt this
      point, you can see a list of selected software patterns. ýEither click the “Software” header,
      or click “Software…” on the “Change…” menu. ýAt this point, you will be presented with a list
      of available software patterns, including the Server Functions patterns: simply check off any
      servers you would like to install and click “OK” to return to your normal installation!

        >Get your fresh kernels from openSUSE and test Linux 3.0!</ulink></title>
    <para>The openSUSE kernel developers have recently announced that the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Kernel">kernel</ulink> git trees have moved to <ulink
        url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/git">kernel.opensuse.org/git</ulink>, providing better
      reliability than gitorious. Gitorious had trouble with cloning the nearly 1GB repository
      sometimes, but the developers will keep syncing to gitorious so nothing should break.
      Moreover, <ulink url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/">kernel.opensuse.org</ulink> offers an easy
      interface to install openSUSE kernels on a variety of openSUSE releases.</para>
    <para>More things are planned for kernel.opensuse.org including the introduction <ulink
        url="http://lxr.linux.no/">LXR</ulink>. <ulink url="http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/about/"
        >cgit</ulink> was already added during the writing of this article!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">What is there – daily fresh kernels!</emphasis></para>
    <para><ulink url="http://kernel.opensuse.org">kernel.opensuse.org</ulink> offers an interface
      for users to find a specific version of a kernel for openSUSE. As <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Kernel">the wiki</ulink> states, there is a number of different
      kernels build for openSUSE. This includes the default kernel (usable for desktops and
      real-hardware servers), the desktop kernel, optimized for desktop usage and a number of more
      specialized kernels including Xen and EC2 ready kernels, debug, trace and of course a vanilla
      (standard kernel.org) kernel. On kernel.opensuse.org you can find (links to) repositories for
      all current openSUSE and SLE releases with up to date versions of all the mentioned kernels
      and more. Most of these are build daily to keep ‘em fresh!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Follow upstream</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you want to follow upstream kernel development closely, <ulink
        url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/branches/vanilla">vanilla</ulink> is probably your thing.
      This will turn into the upcoming <emphasis role="bold">Linux 3.0 kernel</emphasis>! If you
      feel adventurous and want to test patches that are not yet ready to go in the mainline kernel,
      check the <ulink url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/branches/linux-next">linux-next
        branch</ulink>. These are patches which will go into ‘Linux 3.1′, the upcoming+1 version of
      the Linux kernel.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Or track openSUSE</emphasis></para>
    <para>Or, you might want to test what is coming in the next openSUSE release via the <ulink
        url="http://kernel.opensuse.org/branches/master">‘master branch’</ulink>. This will give you
      a kernel that is ahead even of the Factory kernel! Each of those kernels is build for a large
      number of build targets including openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and a number of SLE versions.
      Clicking on Packages (under the Tools menu top-right) and then the kernel branch you like (the
      kernel from openSUSE 11.4, SLES10_SP3, linus’ git tree ‘vanilla’, etc) will show you the
      repository and how to add it. These kernels are build daily, so tracking what the kernel
      developers are up to is easy as pie!</para>
    <para>Michal Marek, working on kernel.opensuse.org told us that:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>master, openSUSE-11.3, openSUSE-11.4, vanilla, stable and linux-next should work on any
        of 11.3, 11.4 and Factory. I fixed the spec files now so that the packages also install on
        11.2, but that release is out of support, anyway.</para>
    </blockquote>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">How to use it</emphasis></para>
    <para>To add a specific kernel to openSUSE, click on the branch you are looking for and then on
        <emphasis role="italic">packages</emphasis> under the Tools menu. You will then see the
      zypper command which will help you add this kernel to your openSUSE installation.</para>
    <para>By default, the kernel will replace your old kernel. If you want to be keep the old one as
      a fallback, go to /etc/zypp/zypp.conf and uncomment the line starting with "multiversion =".
      For the vanilla and linux-next branches, this is not needed, the default configuration puts
      Linus’ kernel-vanilla next to your default kernel-desktop in parallel. Having the kernel
      available as option the boot menu and not replacing your current kernel protects you from
      issues with the latest piece of technology you are testing out!</para>

    <para>Over the last year an openSUSE strategy discussion has been ongoing. Beginning this year

    <para><emphasis role="bold">openSUSE Conference</emphasis></para>
    <para>Now in its third year, the openSUSE Conference has become one of the most dynamic and
      collaborative events in the FOSS world, by bringing together both openSUSE contributors and
      other members of the open source community. Last year we welcomed participants from Fedora,
      Debian, the GNOME project and numerous others, creating a rich environment for innovation.
      Topics for the openSUSE Conference range from technical talks about packaging, Open Build
      Service and development tools to more community-oriented discussions about our future and
      direction. With over 35% more attendees than in 2009, last year’s conference was a resounding
      success and this year promises to be even greater with an expected number of 500
      attendees.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Sponsors needed</emphasis></para>
    <para>To make this event possible, the community needs help. Sponsorship is required for travel
      costs for speakers and attendees as well as facilities costs. As the openSUSE community is
      very international, we want to support people from Brazil, India, Australia and many other
      countries to come to Nuremberg. By securing sponsorships, companies can demonstrate their
      support for the community and garner valuable brand recognition. If you are interested in
      sponsoring this event, please see the <ulink

        Results</ulink></title>
    <para>Yesterday was World IPv6 Day and openSUSE <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/31/opensuse-and-world-ipv6-day/">participated</ulink>
      in it. We hope the experiment was as successful for the other participants as it was for
      us!</para>
    <para>Here is a short status update from the openSUSE infrastructure. openSUSE has currently two
      major server locations and we tested IPv6 at both separately. Note that there are more
      openSUSE infrastructure locations, including the server which runs the popular <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/09/planet.opensuse.org">planet.opensuse.org</ulink>
      (which supports IPv6 as well now)!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Nürnberg</emphasis></para>
    <para>In Nürnberg, Germany, the following main services were enabled:</para>

    <para>Just two services did not make it in time: the torrent tracker and the email servers. Our
      current tracker software does not support IPv6 – and the dedicated new tracker needs more love
      from our packager. The mail servers are provided by our ISP so we left them as they
      were.</para>
    <para>All our other services are <emphasis role="bold">RUNNNING on IPv4+IPv6</emphasis> and
        <emphasis role="bold">WILL STAY on IPv4+IPv6</emphasis> even if the IPv6 day is over now. We

      how useful the World IPv6 day was for us:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Native IPv6 users reported problems which are MTU related. Manually lowering the MTU
          on the client side fixed their problems, but this is something that we are working on
          closely together with our ISP.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Some sites are not accessible from some clients. But clients from the same subnet did
          not have the problems. More mysterious: the problematic clients can reach other servers
          without problems. This is currently the problem which needs some deep
          investigation.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>We are currently discussing whether we can solve these issues quickly or have to disable
      IPv6 again for our servers in Provo.</para>
    <para>The following problems were solved during World IPv6 day:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>One package on our openSUSE distribution needed patches: the apache2-mod_geoip package

      <listitem>
        <para>we found two packages (vsftpd and torrent-seeder) which can’t handle IPv4 and IPv6 at
          the same time</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>In conclusion, the world IPv6 day participation showed openSUSE to be quite ready for IPv6
      – and we will work on fixing the few problems we encountered.</para>

    <para>The software from the <emphasis role="bold"><ulink url="http://www.oyranos.org/">Oyranos
          Project</ulink></emphasis> is also part of the medical repository and in openSUSE Medical.
      It allows medical professionals to view medical file formats like DICOMM Files.</para>
    <para>The newest addition to the medical repository is <ulink url="http://bit.ly/lQuA0S"
        >plasmoid-glucose</ulink>, a KDE Plasmoid for diabetics.</para>
    <para>The openSUSE medical project has been a success. The SUSE gallery image has been
      downloaded well over 1400 times and was cloned by 162 users so they could provide their own
      variations of openSUSE Medical!</para>
    <para>The team is very much interested in more feedback, however. Especially when it comes to
      real-life usage of openSUSE Medical. Feedback from professionals in the field using the
      software can be very valuable in improving it and would be highly appreciated. So if you study
      medicine, work at a pharmacy or are a doctor and you use or might use openSUSE Medical, please
      let us know! You could tell the whole team by <ulink
        url="mailto:opensuse-medical+subscribe@opensuse.org">subscribing to the openSUSE Medical
        mailing list</ulink> which is very low-trafic (3-4 mails per week) or contact one of the
      team members like <ulink url="mailto:saigkill@opensuse.org">Sascha Manns</ulink> directly. Of
      course you are also very much welcome on the <ulink
        url="irc://irc.opensuse.org/opensuse-medical">openSUSE Medical IRC channel</ulink> and can
      join the <ulink url="http://on.fb.me/clGDk7">facebook page</ulink>!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">New leadership and project plans</emphasis></para>
    <para>Today, the team announces a shift in leadership and a road map for the future.</para>
    <para>Two years after the start of this project, the former team leader Sascha Manns has stepped
      down and Thanasis Rous will take over. Last November, the first official release was published
      with a range of desktop and server packages. openSUSE medical is now part of the <ulink
        url="http://www.linux.com/community/groups/viewgroup/1264-Medical+Task+Force">Linux Medical
        Taskforce</ulink> and has exciting plans for the future. These include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Importing more applications dealing with diabetes care and diabetics</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Importing applications that would be useful for medical students (some educational
          applications like Kalzium are already added)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Bug testing applications (maybe create a new mailing list for this purpose e.g
          “opensuse-medical-bugs”)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Translating the included applications into more languages</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The new leader Athanasios-Ilias yesterday has released the new image under <ulink
        url="http://susegallery.com/a/UbPYJM/opensuse-medical-114">SUSE Gallery</ulink>. Also
      available at : OVF image, VMware Image, Live CD/DVD.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">More information and helping out</emphasis></para>
    <para>Anyone interested in the project can read more about it at the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Medical">Medical wiki portal</ulink>.</para>
    <para>There are many ways to help with working in the project – you don’t need to be a developer
      or packager, nor do you need to be a medical specialist, though of course these skill sets are
      very welcome. If you’re not sure how to help, sign up to the mailing list and introduce
      yourself. If you’re a user of this software and would like to see it develop in certain
      directions, this is also a great place to get your ideas heard.</para>
    <para>If you want to get involved, subscribe to the mailing list with “<ulink
        url="mailto:opensuse-medical+subscribe@opensuse.org"
        >opensuse-medical+subscribe@opensuse.org</ulink>“. We very much welcome your
      feedback!</para>

      <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/01/volunteers-needed-conference/">Volunteers
        needed for the conference</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>As you know, the third international <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/">openSUSE
        Conference</ulink> is happening in a couple of weeks from now, you already should be <ulink
        url="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2"
        >registered</ulink>! For the organization team this means that we are really picking up pace
      now and start to feel dizzy. One of the reasons for that is that we are short on helping
      hands. We especially miss <emphasis role="italic">“boots on the ground</emphasis>“, <emphasis
        role="bold">we need your help!</emphasis></para>
    <para>Being a boot on the ground means we need people to help us at the conference in September.
      There is no special knowledge about the location or other details needed. So far we have 5
      tasks where we desperately need people to help out. Venue setup, Registration Desk, Session
      Chairs and the Snack Bar. Read on to learn how you can contribute to the success of the
      conference.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold"><ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#Venue_Setup">Venue
          Setup</ulink></emphasis></para>
    <para>The Zentrifuge is not an event location in the classical sense so we have to do a lot of
      setup tasks the days before the conference starts. For instance we need to make sure that the
      seminar rooms have enough chairs, multisockets and a working projector. We also need to setup
      the lounge with sofas, equip the Beergarden with tables, distribute waste bins and so on and
      so on. Most of this we will need to do on Friday/Saturday before the conference and it’s a lot
      of physical labor. If you can help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or let
      us know at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold"><ulink url="">The Registration Desk</ulink></emphasis></para>
    <para>At the conference, every morning from 9:00 to 10:30, we will have a registration desk. It
      will handle the registration of new visitors,  distribution of info materials and answering of
      general questions and such. We need two people per day to man this desk during the conference.
      On Sunday, as it’s the first day, it better be three! If you can help with this please lets us
      know on the volunteers page or let us know at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold"><ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#Session_Chair">Session
          Chair</ulink></emphasis></para>
    <para>We have two floors in the Zentrifuge and both have a main room and some smaller rooms for
      workshops and birds of a feather sessions. For both floors we need two people per day to be a
      chair for the sessions that will take place. Being a chair means that you introduce the next
      presenter, make sure the sessions stick to the schedule and answer all questions speakers
      might have. This task takes a bit of experience as speaker/moderator to make the
      introductions, a wristwatch and, ideally, some technical knowledge with projectors/laptops. If
      you can help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or drop us a mail
      at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold"><ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#The_Bar">The Snack
        Bar</ulink></emphasis></para>
    <para>This year we will run our own snack bar at the venue. The organization team has already
      seen to that foods and drinks are available and that we have a fully equipped snack bar
      ready.  Now we need people that help us to man the snack bar to sell, sell, sell. You would
      need to sell snacks and drinks, make sure that we don’t run out and count the moneys! If you
      can help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or drop us a mail
      atopensuse-conference@opensuse.org.</para>
    <para><ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers#Evening_Manager_and_Lock_Service"
          ><emphasis role="bold">Evening Manager and Lock Service</emphasis></ulink></para>
    <para>One nice side effect of the Zentrifuge not being a classical event location is that we
      will have very long opening hours. People can continue to collaborate and don’t have to leave
      the place until 23:00. But this also means that we have to have at least one person per day
      that makes sure it doesn’t get to wild and that closes everything in the night. If you can
      help with this please lets us know on the volunteers page or drop us a mail
      at opensuse-conference@opensuse.org.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Other tasks</emphasis></para>
    <para>The team held couple of meetings which resulted in a nice list of stuff to do, like
      organizing hardware for the venue, ordering internet, food and drinks and so on. If you rather
      want to help with this, you’re more than welcome to contribute to the conferences success! A
      good start is to subscribe to our mailing list and participate in our meetings.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Thanks a lot in advance!</emphasis></para>

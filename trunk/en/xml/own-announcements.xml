        Green Planet</ulink></title>
    <para>The last few days those of you linked to the planet by <ulink url="http://planetsuse.org/"
        >http://planetsuse.org/</ulink> are experiencing connection problems. This is not because
      openSUSE Planet is down but as Pascal Bleser announced a few days ago into the openSUSE
      Project ML because this domain name is not under the Project’s control but by and individual
      who left the openSUSE Project some years ago. </para>
    <para>The only way to go to the openSUSE planet is now by typing http://planet.opensuse.org/ and
      the correct way to connect your RSS is by adding <ulink
        url="http://planet.opensuse.org/global/rss20.xml">that</ulink> .xml . </para>
    <para>In case you are experiencing troubles with your aggregator please contact
      admin@opensuse.org there is someone there to help you solve any problem you might have.</para>

      G+</ulink></title>
    <para>The IT world moves fast and along with it does social networking. It’s been only a few
      days since Google <ulink
        url="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/google-pages-connect-with-all-things.html"
        >announced</ulink> the limited availability of Google+ pages and already thousands of
      Google-plussers have created a Google+ page. Of course, we’re social too and thus the openSUSE
      project now has an official Google+ page!</para>
    <para> If you are created a page for an openSUSE community, like Kostas for the Greece
      community, then don’t forget to add your page to <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Social_media_contacts#Social_networks">openSUSE Social
        media contacts</ulink> so that openSUSE enthusiasts can easily <ulink
        url="http://gpc.fm/l/opensuseusers">find the official pages and add it</ulink> to their
      circles. That page is also a reference for other social media activities that openSUSE is
      involved in like Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.</para>
    <para>Also, if you like to get involved promoting openSUSE on social media and networks, please
      talk with the openSUSE marketing team.</para>
    <para>I’d like to thank Roger Luedecke for taking care of the new openSUSE Google + page and
      invite everybody to share contents on it, promote it and follow what we do!</para>

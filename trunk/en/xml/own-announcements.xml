    <para>We’re almost there. In two days openSUSE once again releases a new, improved version of
      its distribution to the world. Reason to celebrate! And celebrate we will. Currently, about 11
      parties have been registered but we know many more are being organized and we call out to you
      to <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties">add your party to the wiki

    <para>The IT world moves fast and along with it does social networking. It’s been only a few
      days since Google <ulink
        url="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/google-pages-connect-with-all-things.html"
        >announced</ulink> the limited availability of Google+ pages and already thousands of
      Google-plussers have created a Google+ page. Of course, we’re social too and thus the openSUSE
      project now has an official Google+ page!</para>
    <para> If you are created a page for an openSUSE community, like Kostas for the Greece
      community, then don’t forget to add your page to <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Social_media_contacts#Social_networks">openSUSE Social
        media contacts</ulink> so that openSUSE enthusiasts can easily <ulink
        url="http://gpc.fm/l/opensuseusers">find the official pages and add it</ulink> to their
      circles. That page is also a reference for other social media activities that openSUSE is
      involved in like Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.</para>
    <para>Also, if you like to get involved promoting openSUSE on social media and networks, please
      talk with the openSUSE marketing team.</para>
    <para>I’d like to thank Roger Luedecke for taking care of the new openSUSE Google + page and
      invite everybody to share contents on it, promote it and follow what we do!</para>

    </title>
    <para>The development process of the Open Build Service (OBS) code base as well as it’s
      accompanying tools is largely test-driven. Major parts of the OBS source code are covered by a
      comprehensive test-suite. Traditionally, after each new code submission, these tests have been
      run by a custom shell-script on a local machine that wasn’t publicly available for several
      reasons. Even though this setup served us well for a long time, but we needed more. We want to
      provide a more transparent solution that allows the community to participate and maybe take
      over some responsibilities. Thus, your hard-working OBS-team hereby kindly introduces
      ci.opensuse.org, our new public interface for continuous integration (CI) testing!

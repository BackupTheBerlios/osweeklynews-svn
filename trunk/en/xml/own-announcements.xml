    <para>We’re almost there. In two days openSUSE once again releases a new, improved version of

    </title>
    <para>The development process of the Open Build Service (OBS) code base as well as it’s
      accompanying tools is largely test-driven. Major parts of the OBS source code are covered by a
      comprehensive test-suite. Traditionally, after each new code submission, these tests have been
      run by a custom shell-script on a local machine that wasn’t publicly available for several
      reasons. Even though this setup served us well for a long time, but we needed more. We want to
      provide a more transparent solution that allows the community to participate and maybe take
      over some responsibilities. Thus, your hard-working OBS-team hereby kindly introduces
      ci.opensuse.org, our new public interface for continuous integration (CI) testing!

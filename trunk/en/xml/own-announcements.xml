    <para>Next years <ulink url="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/">FOSDEM</ulink> takes place again in
      Brussels on Feb 5th and 6th 2011 and openSUSE will be present as usual!</para>
    <para>Apart of the well known high level open Source tech conference there will be for the 2nd
      time the Distribution <ulink url="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/distrominiconf">Miniconf</ulink>.
      The Miniconf provides the perfect place for different projects to share ideas, talk about
      challenges each project has and to foster collaboration – and as openSUSE is all about
      collaboration we want to play a major role there.</para>
    <para>The Miniconf is open for every project. For more information please subscribe on the
      Miniconf <ulink url="http://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/dist2011">mailinglist</ulink>.
      We are looking for talks about cross-distro collaboration and presentations on openSUSE
      technology – like OBS, openFATE but also where we are going – things like Tumbleweed!</para>
    <para>Our contact with FOSDEM is <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel">Henne
        Vogelsang</ulink>, if you think about giving a talk, contact him.</para>

    <para>In February 2010 openSUSE held the openSUSE survey 2010 to find out more about the community. Who are the openSUSE users? What do they want? Who are our contributors? 
      What motivates them? How can openSUSE improve? These questions and more have, to some extend, been answered by the over 27.000 participants in the three months the survey 
      was live. Just before the end of the year we finally managed to get the winner of the Chumby <xref linkend="fig.chumby"/> his prize. Konrad Schlichtherle from Dortmund, 
      Germany, is the lucky winner. Read on for more!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Winners</emphasis></para>
    <para>The winners of the prizes we gave away were, in no particular order:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Yosef Peretz from Jerusalem Israel</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Carlos Gárzon from Colombia</para></listitem>

    <para>And the main prize, the Chumby, went to <emphasis role="bold">Konrad Schlichtherle</emphasis> from Germany.</para>
    <para>We managed to catch Konrad on IRC – he is currently not involved with Free Software but looking to change that so tips for him are welcome!</para>
    <screen>
      News.o.o: So, Konrad, you got the Chumby?
      Konrad: yes, i got it on the 27th. Many thanks for it. Its a nice gadget!
      News.o.o: So it’s working for you?
      Konrad: Yes, what else can I say about the Chumby? He stands beside me and plays music. I have to say, I use Linux since one year and have a lot to learn. I hope to 
      use the Chumby with some other useful things so I can learn more about Linux.

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Survey results</emphasis></para>
    <para>The survey results are available as <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/images/3/3a/SurveySummary_03012010.pdf">pdf file</ulink> and on the openSUSE Survey 
      2010 <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Survey_2010">wiki page</ulink> an extensive analysis has been made. The results have helped make project 
      decisions, be it technical, marketing or otherwise – and we call upon all openSUSE community members to keep using these numbers to back up their choices! We want to be 
      close to ourselves and the opinions of 27,000 users and contributors is nothing to be sneezed at.</para>
    <para>We’d like to thank everyone who answered the questionnaire again for their time and efforts and wish the winners a lot of fun with their prizes and their future 
      endeavors in the world of Free Software! And as usual, if you’re looking into getting involved, you can simply contact anyone on IRC or mail – that includes me, your 
      humble writer. Find me on IRC <ulink url="http://webchat.freenode.net/">(freenode.net in the openSUSE channels like #opensuse-project)</ulink> under the 
      nick jospoortvliet!</para>

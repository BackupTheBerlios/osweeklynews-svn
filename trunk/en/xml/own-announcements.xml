        openSUSE Tumbleweed project</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>There's been many discussions over the past years about a "rolling update" version of
      openSUSE on lots of different mailing lists and in person a different conferences. So the time
      now is to stop talking about it, and actually trying to do it :) So, I'd like to propose
      "openSUSE Tumbleweed" a repo that is a rolling updated version of openSUSE containing the
      latest "stable" versions of packages for people to use. (...)</para>

      >Feature handling for openSUSE reworked</ulink></title>
    <para>openFATE, the feature tracking tool used in openSUSE has been completely reworked and
      the new version is live now on features.opensuse.org. A team has started driving the
      handling of features and we’d like to update you with the current state and invite you to
      participate. The new version is now live and contains a long list of new features so that
      features can be handled completely with the new web user interface. The interface uses the
      new openSUSE Bento theme to fit in better in the openSUSE site family, has several search
      options to allow the screening team to find features easily, it’s possible to edit all
      fields and also the product states. Thanks to the openSUSE boosters, especially to Thomas
      Schmidt, for the new version. The new team has defined a workflow to handle features and
      described it in the openSUSE wiki. (EDITMARK)<xref linkend="fig.fate"/></para>

    <para>After a slightly-too-big dinner last night your strategy team
      spend all day working on the strategy docs. We&apos;ve spend most of
      that time trying to shorten it without loosing the essential
      information in there &ndash; trying to make it more readable. I
      think we did reasonable well &ndash; the results are on <ulink url="https://lite.co-ment.com/text/lNPCgzeGHdV/view/">co-ment</ulink> again. (...)</para>

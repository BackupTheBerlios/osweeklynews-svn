    <para>Apart from being a tasty Bavarian bread-snack, <ulink
        url="http://socialdesktop.org/bretzn">Bretzn</ulink> is a code-name for a collection of
      technology aimed at solving a problem which has existed in software development for a very
      long time: “How do you get your applications to your users?”</para>
    <mediaobject>

    <para>Screenshots of the Bretzn plugin interface This is particularly a question for the many
      developers of applications that are not part of a project like GNOME or KDE. These developers
      must either provide binaries for a range of distributions themselves or hope that distribution
      volunteers will do the packaging for them. Don’t they all dream of a better solution? </para>
    <para>In the open source community, we already have many individual bits of this dream in place.
      We have of course our powerful <ulink url="">here </ulink>(scroll to the comments) Nokia might
      be interested in adding support for other platforms like Windows and Mac OS X too! Moreover,
      we have the Open Collaboration Services (OCS) which allows for the easy, socially networked
      publishing of packages both to and from central software download sites such as
      openDesktop.org and KDE-Apps.org as well as application stores like Meego/Maemo and we have
      many powerful integrated development environments such as Qt Creator, KDevelop and Eclipse. </para>
    <para>Until now these technologies and tools made up mostly isolated islands and it seemed an
      obvious choice to try bridging them. A project aiming to do just this began in August 2010 and
      was first publicly <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/26/from-the-developer-to-the-user-and-back-announcing-project-bretzn/"
        >announced by Frank Karlitschek</ulink> at the openSuse Conference in Nuremberg in late
      October: Project Bretzn would make it possible, with a few clicks, to publish software
      projects directly from the IDE – and it would all happen before the end of the year!</para>

    <para>Project Bretzn, then, is not a single piece of software, but rather an attempt to fill in
      the holes which exist in what is already there. As it stands, the project has produced two
      core pieces of software:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A thin client in the shape of a Qt Creator plugin, accessed through the Tools menu
            in the IDE. The plugin lets you perform all the actions required to get data sent to the
            various build services and publishing sites, by contacting the server part, which then
            distributes the information to the appropriate places. The implementation of this also
            prompted amending the <ulink
              url="http://api.kde.org/kdesupport-api/kdesupport-apidocs/attica-git/html/"
              >Attica</ulink> library with new features. As some will already know, Attica <xref
              linkend="fig.appmanager"/>is a full featured implementation of a OCS client library
            built by KDE which is now officially included in the MeeGo platform. The Qt Creator
            plugin is developed so that it is based on a thin library to make its functionality
            easily portable to other IDE’s like Anjuta or Eclipse – consider this an invite!</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A server library, designed to plug into the OCS reference server implementation as
            published by the <ulink url="http://socialdesktop.org/bretzn">Social Desktop
              project</ulink>. This is the part of the system which draws the lines between the
            dots: It contacts any number of build services that you request your software to be
            built on and when you request it, it publishes the packages resulting of those build
            jobs on the distribution sites and services. The publishing system requires only of the
            remote sites that they implement the content module part of OCS, which many places
            already do.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <figure id="fig.ubuntu">

          />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>Moreover, work on a KDE client to download and install applications has started at the
      recent <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/27/first-bretzn-sprint-opensuse-app-store-on-the-horizon/"
        >openSUSE Bretzn sprint in Nuremberg</ulink>. The screenshot in this article shows a first
      prototype. And at the <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/26/app-installer-meeting-or-more-collaboration-accross-borders/"
        >Cross-distribution meeting on an application installer</ulink>, just before the Bretzn
      sprint was held, it was decided the GNOME desktop will receive a client most likely based on
      Ubuntu’s Software center. <xref linkend="fig.appmanager"/></para>
    <para>Most importantly, all this has the distinction of being open: not only is the source code
      for the software above freely available as you would expect, but the web API created as the
      communications layer between those two components is free and open, and indeed a part of the
      Open Collaboration Services specification as of version 1.6.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Publishing Renewed </emphasis></para>
    <para>The best software is that which gets out of your way to let you do your work, and Bretzn
      was designed with this in mind. What this means is that when you are ready to publish your
      software, you call up the tool and enter the required information only once. If the same
      information is required for multiple publishing sites, the plugin will take care of that. The
      source archive is created for you when you select which folder contains your source code, and
      you only need to select the targets you wish to build for to get binaries for your application
      for all the platforms. </para>
    <para>Even with the build services, building the binary packages does take a while. So, Bretzn
      was designed to not require you to follow this all the time, but rather as a system in which
      you create the build jobs, and then simply close the plugin and let the build service do its
      magic while you continue working on other things. </para>
    <para>When publishing the software, you will normally have to give notice to many people and
      organizations if you wish for that knowledge to be spread. Through Bretzn, this information
      can be pushed to these people as the publishing happens. Information can be shared through the
      social networking features of the Open Collaboration Services on the sites the application is
      published to. For example, users may be subscribed to updates about a single application, or
      to activities performed by a friend, which are for example the publishing of
      applications.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Who build it? </emphasis></para>
    <para>The project is a collaboration between <ulink url="http://hive01.com/">h i v e 01</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://openslx.org/">Open-SLX</ulink> and <ulink url="http://nokia.com/"
        >Nokia</ulink>, and specifically it has been the task of Sebastian Kugler, Dan Leinir
      Turthra Jensen and Frank Karlitschek to get the project working. Over the last four months,
      they have been working tirelessly to construct the bridges which make up the Bretzn project,
      both in software by writing the code, and socially by speaking with a lot of people about the
      goals of the project to find out just what is needed, as well as making those whose systems
      Bretzn bridges aware of what they have been doing. Part of the latter was being involved with
      the <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/01/26/app-installer-meeting-or-more-collaboration-accross-borders/"
        >Cross-distribution meeting on an application installer</ulink>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">And, It Is Available Right Now </emphasis></para>
    <para>Though the majority of the code has been developed in the open, the various bits of code
      have now been officially released:<itemizedlist>

      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>We invite you, the developers of the world, to use the results of this project and bring
      your software to the world directly from Qt Creator and help us bring this to other IDE’s like
      Eclipse but also vim and Emacs. And finally: Since all of this software is released under free
      licenses, the team further invites you to join the development of the Bretzn components
      themselves – not only in their current incarnations, but also to add functionality like
      Facebook, identi.ca, blogger and Twitter plugins to spread the word there. </para>

      <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/25/testing-at-opensuse/">Help out with testing at
        openSUSE</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>One of the most important activities during software development is testing. In FOSS
      community, software often gets tested by the developers themselves, other developers and
      volunteers. During the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1">openSUSE 12.1</ulink>
      development process it has been important to keep <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory">Factory</ulink> working properly. Testing this
      is however a rather boring, repetitive task: the tester has to boot up a Factory ISO as often
      as possible and check if the basic applications start up and work. We don’t like boring tasks
      so the openSUSE Project has been using the automated testing framework <ulink
        url="http://openqa.opensuse.org">openQA</ulink> to test this release daily!</para>
    <para>This article explains how <emphasis role="bold">openQA</emphasis> works and how you can
      help keep Factory working! We’ll also give some links to more information about testing to
      help new testers learn the trade but also give experienced testers some new tips and insights!

    <title><ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/14/interview-about-openqa/"> Interview about
        openQA</ulink></title>
    <para>Last week, <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org%22%22">openQA 1.0</ulink> was released. We
      did an interview with Bernhard Wiedeman, the main developer of openQA.</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">First of all, whatýs your job regarding the openQA project?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>My role in the project was to wish for, envision, design, organize and implement most of
      openQA and OS-autoinst (the test-engine powering the openQA service). I made it do what was
      needed most and added things others wanted as well. Actually, my job at SUSE (doing cloud
      stuff) is completely unrelated to openQA, which is still my hobby project. (...)</para>

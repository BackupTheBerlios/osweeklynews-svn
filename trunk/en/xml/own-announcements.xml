      2011</ulink></title>
    <para>The third openSUSE Conference, <emphasis role="bold">osc11</emphasis>, kicks off on
        <emphasis role="bold">Sunday September 11</emphasis>, 2011 in <emphasis role="bold"
        >Nuremberg, Germany</emphasis>. Under the motto <emphasis role="bold">RWX</emphasis> all
      Free and Open Source Software enthusiasts are invited to come together for four days
        to<emphasis role="bold"> learn</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">hack</emphasis> and to
        <emphasis role="bold">have a lot of fun</emphasis>. The program will cover a variety topics
      with an emphasis on interaction between participants. The conference is <emphasis role="bold"
        >free of charge and open to anyone!</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">OSC – The annual meeting of the community</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/community.png"
        width="50%"/></para>
    <para>The conference is the yearly get-together of the openSUSE community to give its people a
      chance to meet face to face, talk to and inspire each other. Having the chance to chat on the
      hallway, to quickly throw some ideas together on a whiteboard or to watch over each others
      shoulders while hacking can easily substitute endless chat sessions, thousand-mail threads on
      a mailing list and tiresome telephone calls. Being together in one room, even in this day and
      age, beats every other collaboration method and is what forges cohesion and friendships. That
      is why the openSUSE Project tries to get together this conference every year for its
      contributors. But not only for them, the conference is also for anyone using, working with or
      taking advantage of the project. No matter if you use our technology, if you are one of our
      many friends from free and open source upstream projects or if you contribute to another
      GNU/Linux distribution this conference is for you.</para>

        location at<ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org"

    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Program – Everybody has to read, write and
      execute</emphasis></para>
    <para>Last year, the conference had the motto <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/?p=5223">‘Collaboration Across Borders’</ulink> and
      brought together an international crowd from many communities. This year we shift our
      attention a bit deeper, aiming for hands-on discussions to get work done. Smaller, more
      focused meetings with a strong “read-write” attitude are at the core of the conference. Hence
      the subtitle of <emphasis role="bold">RWX^3</emphasis>, commonly known as the UNIX acronym for
      “Read, Write, Execute” – three times, for you, your community and the rest of the
      world!</para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/intro.png"
        width="40%"/></para>
    <para>The highlights, like every year, are the keynotes that kick of each day. This year our
      community manager Jos, kernel hacker Greg KH and Michael Miller, marketing vice president of
      SUSE will give the honors. Of course the general program also has a lot of highlights in the
      distribution, community and technology tracks.</para>
    <para>Our distribution is, naturally, one of the topics which receives a lot of focus at our
      conference. Learn from Stefan Seyfried how to run the coolest bleeding edge stuff from the
      development tree while still retaining a reliable system that you can use for daily work. Let
      the Boosters teach you how to leave your own footprints in the distribution by becoming an
      contributor. Or get creative and work with other designers on the artwork for the desktops and
      applications 12.1 then and there.</para>
    <para>Also the “<emphasis role="italic">soft topics</emphasis>” in (Free-) software engineering
      will get their share of attention. Lydia Pintscher gives a workshop to discuss a number of
      topics that often cause social problems in technical communities and Henne Vogelsang
      introduces you to the basics of citizen journalism so you can improve your blogging skills. Or
      how about you help to shape the future of the Ambassador program in a workshop with Kostas
      Koudaras and Manu Gupta?</para>
    <para>Another cluster of topics will evolve around new technology that will bring FOSS and
      openSUSE forward. Robert Schweikert will give you an introduction to the basics of a cloud and
      an overview of the cloud projects in the Open Build Service. Brush up your debugging skills in
      a gdb workshop with Jýrgen Weigert or tag along for the journey of an I/O request through the
      kernel block layer with Suresh Jayaraman.</para>

      about you visit the legen, wait for it…., dary social event on Monday at <ulink

    <para>After two years at the Berufsfýrderungswerk <ulink url="http://www.bfw-nuernberg.de/"/> in
      the outskirts of Nýrnberg, we have found a new location smack in the middle of the city. 10
      minutes away from the center of Nýrnberg, in a former production area of the <emphasis
        role="bold">A</emphasis>llgemeine <emphasis role="bold">E</emphasis>lektricitýts-<emphasis
        role="bold">G</emphasis>esellschaft (<emphasis role="bold">AEG</emphasis>), the conference
      will be hosted by the <ulink url="http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/"><emphasis role="italic"
          >Zentrifuge</emphasis></ulink>. The Zentrifuge is a project that networks cultural
      interested and creative people in the region. The whole location has a special atmosphere of
      an old industrial plant, mixed with art and creativity. The perfect balance between work and
      play which we always aim for at the conference.</para>
    <para>Nýrnberg with a population of 500,000 is the nucleus of the metropolitan region <emphasis
        role="italic">Franconia</emphasis> at the heart of Europe. Located in southern Germany, it
      is midway between Munich and Frankfurt and therefor easily reachable by road, rail and air. As
      a tourist city, known for the Nuremberg Trials and famous for the Christmas Market, Nýrnberg
      has a very good tourist office which will help you with all your needs. The office also
      provides an <ulink

        Conference Program and Keynote Speakers</ulink></title>
    <para>With our <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/osc11/">conference</ulink>,
      osc11, fast approaching (Have you <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/register"
        >registered</ulink> yet? If not, what are you waiting for?!), the excitement is building all
      over the project.</para>
    <para>Its quite some work to get to create a reasonable schedule for a conference. For osc we
      want to have a program with talks that interest all our visitors. And as visitors have a wide
      rage of skill levels we also want to balance the depth of the talks. Another thing we wanted
      to create are “<emphasis role="italic">gravitation centers</emphasis>” for our key topics
      within the program. Oh and we also seek out for new contributors with our conference. And all
      that needs to be sorted between rooms with different sizes, within the tracks you think are
      useful, with breaks, time to change rooms and so on and son on. Quite some parameters to take
      into account. That said, we are very happy that we can announce the schedule for the openSUSE
      Conference 2011 today!</para>
    <para><ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/timetable"

    <para>We have scheduled more than 100 contributions in the four days of the conference. More
      than 50% of those are interactive like <emphasis role="italic">birds of a feather
        sessions</emphasis> (BoFs) and <emphasis role="italic">workshops</emphasis>, that is along
      with our motto RWXý which basically means that people should not only just listen, but also do
      things. (...)</para>

    <para>The Testing Core Team has decided to hold our third <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day">Open Bugs Day </ulink>(OBD) on Sunday
      August 21 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC.</para>
    <para>To ensure that all the testers are using the same code base, we are making Virtual
      Machines available on our server. For those people that wish to test on their own hardware,
      there will be KDE and Gnome virtual images available at <ulink url="http://www5.zq1.de/img/"
        >http://www5.zq1.de/img/</ulink>, and distribution snapshots available at <ulink
        url="http://mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/"
        >http://mirror.zq1.de/opensuse/factory/iso/</ulink>. The virtual images have been prepared
      with KVM and tested with VirtualBox, and are compressed to a little over 900 MB. Instructions
      for using them in a VirtualBox VM are posted at the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Open-Bugs-Day">Open Bugs Day wiki page</ulink>.</para>
    <para>The purpose of this OBD is to test the open bugs reported for openSUSE 11.4 to see which
      of them are still affecting 12.1. As there are over 1300 open bugs for 11.4, we have a major
      job to do. If you have any time available on August 21,ý please join us. Use Channel
      #opensuse-testing on the Freenode IRC Network to get started.</para>

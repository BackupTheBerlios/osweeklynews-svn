        > openSUSE Announces First Public Release of openQA</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>The openSUSE Project announces the 1.0 release of the unique cross-distribution-capable,
      fully automated testing framework <emphasis role="bold"><ulink
          url="http://openqa.opensuse.org">openQA</ulink></emphasis>. openQA is the only
      comprehensive testing tool which can run tests on every level of the OS, from core
      functionality like the bootloader and booting the kernel up to testing applications like
      Firefox and LibreOffice. It shows the results in a convenient web interface and allows testers
      to see screenshots and even <emphasis role="italic">videos</emphasis> of the issues found.
      openQA is used to run nightly tests of the ‘Factory’ development repository for the upcoming
        <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1">openSUSE 12.1 release</ulink>. openQA is
      available under the GPL version 2 or later. (...)</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/14/interview-about-openqa/"> Interview about
        openQA</ulink></title>
    <para>Last week, <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org%22%22">openQA 1.0</ulink> was released. We
      did an interview with Bernhard Wiedeman, the main developer of openQA.</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">First of all, whatýs your job regarding the openQA project?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>My role in the project was to wish for, envision, design, organize and implement most of
      openQA and OS-autoinst (the test-engine powering the openQA service). I made it do what was
      needed most and added things others wanted as well. Actually, my job at SUSE (doing cloud
      stuff) is completely unrelated to openQA, which is still my hobby project. (...)</para>

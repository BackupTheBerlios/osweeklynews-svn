        to welcome 16 GSOC students!</ulink></title>
    <para>We’ve got excellent news! We’ve received many excellent submissions for our <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_2011">Google Summer of Code</ulink> application
      and Google has given us 16 slots. This means that 16 eager students have been selected and
      will start working with their mentors on an awesome openSUSE project!</para>
    <para>According to the <ulink
        url="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline">GSOC
        timeline</ulink> the students will now start with the <ulink
        url="http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-what-is-this-community-bonding-all.html"
        >Community Bonding period</ulink> in which they have time to set up their development stuff,
      get acquainted with their mentors and get to know the openSUSE community. This means we’ll see
      those students on our communication channels, be it IRC, forums or mailing lists! Give them a
      warm welcome!</para>
    <para> In a little over three weeks, the coding will start. I’m sure you’re all excited to find
      out what projects these students will be working on! Well, we were too, so we’ve compiled a
      nice list of the accepted proposals and asked a few students a quick quote on IRC!

        11.4 DVDs for Events</ulink></title>
    <para>Following the huge success for filling requests of openSUSE 11.3 media in <ulink

      groups, universities etc.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The PromoDVDs</emphasis></para>
    <para>These <quote>PromoDVDs</quote> are meant to promote openSUSE and help users get a quick
      taste of what we have to offer. A PromoDVD is different from the usual openSUSE DVD’s you can
      download from our <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/114/en">download portal</ulink>.
      They contain a reduced set of packages for installation to make room for a Live GNOME and Live
      KDE image. And the DVD’s are double-sided with both 32 and 64 bit on one disc!</para>
    <para>In some countries, where network connections are an issue, users can bring these DVD’s
      from an event home for installation. In other places, the Live images and added convenience
      giving people a chance to test drive and see right away why openSUSE is a great distro for
      them!</para>

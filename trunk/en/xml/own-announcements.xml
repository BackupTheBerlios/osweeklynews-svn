      visitors. The 17th LinuxTag presents all the latest for professional users, decision makers,
      developers, beginners and the Linux community — <emphasis role="bold">May 11 to 14 at the

    <para>A big kudos to all our ambassadors who are working very hard to let the world know about
      openSUSE! They have been organizing events, speaking to people and writing about the
      awesomeness of openSUSE Project. Below are a few events that were openSUSE boosted in the last
      few days by our ambassadors. We probably still missed some as it can be hard to track
      everything that’s going on! (...)</para>

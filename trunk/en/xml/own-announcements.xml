    <para>As you know, the third international <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/">openSUSE
        Conference</ulink> is happening in a couple of weeks. You already should be <ulink
        url="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2"
        >registered</ulink>. For the organization teams that means they are really coming onto speed
      now and it starts to feel dizzy.</para>
    <para>We had a couple of public meetings which resulted in a nice <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_todo_list">list of stuff to do</ulink>, like
      organizing hardware for the venue, set up internet, foods and drinks and so on. This is all
      done by community members and open for your help. If you want to help, you’re more than
      welcome to contribute to the conferences success. A good start is to subscribe to the
      mailinglist opensuse-conference@opensuse.org .</para>
    <para>If you prefer to give a hand during the conference days, also great, we are looking
        for<emphasis role="bold">volunteers</emphasis>. Many hands are needed to get the event going
      and it would be good if we could share the work so that it’s more fun for everybody.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Please</emphasis> go through the list on <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers">the volunteers page</ulink> and
      find where you could jump in and help. Simply add your name or nick into the list where you
      feel comfortable to help.</para>

    <para>Again this year, same procedure as every year, the <emphasis role="bold">openSUSE Project
        is attending the <ulink url="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag in Berlin</ulink></emphasis>
      with more than 30 members, a booth, several talks in the program and workshops. LinuxTag has
      been held regularly for 15 years, which is longer than any other Linux fair in Europe. More
      than 200 free software projects and companies participate and it attracts nearly 12,000
      visitors. The 17th LinuxTag presents all the latest for professional users, decision makers,
      developers, beginners and the Linux community — <emphasis role="bold">May 11 to 14 at the

        11.4 DVDs for Events</ulink></title>
    <para>Following the huge success for filling requests of openSUSE 11.3 media in <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/02/18/help-the-project-spread-opensuse-dvds/"
        >February</ulink>, we have produced openSUSE 11.4 DVDs to distribute at events, Linux user
      groups, universities etc.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The PromoDVDs</emphasis></para>
    <para>These <quote>PromoDVDs</quote> are meant to promote openSUSE and help users get a quick
      taste of what we have to offer. A PromoDVD is different from the usual openSUSE DVD’s you can
      download from our <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/114/en">download portal</ulink>.
      They contain a reduced set of packages for installation to make room for a Live GNOME and Live
      KDE image. And the DVD’s are double-sided with both 32 and 64 bit on one disc!</para>
    <para>In some countries, where network connections are an issue, users can bring these DVD’s
      from an event home for installation. In other places, the Live images and added convenience
      giving people a chance to test drive and see right away why openSUSE is a great distro for
      them!</para>

        to LFNW</ulink></title>
    <para>Following in the growing list of appearances we’re making worldwide, openSUSE will land in
      Bellingham, Washington for the LinuxFest Northwest conference ( LFNW ) on Saturday, April 30
      and Sunday, May 1 at the Bellingham Technical College. We’re excited to be joining in the
      festivities there, along with an exxpected attendance of over 1,000 visitors, running a booth
      and 3 presentations, doing our best to help make the event interesting and successful for
      everyone. Doing what we do best, you’ll find the same great booth you’ve come to expect at
      other events. There, you’ll be able to pick up a DVD of openSUSE 11.4, just released last
      month amid great reviews. You’ll also be able to show your support for openSUSE and LFNW at
      the same time by buying an openSUSE T-shirt for just $5. Every dollar we make will go directly
      to supporting the great work of the LFNW crew. These FOSS events are very important to the
      community and openSUSE wants to do its part to promote that. For those of you that prefer a
      game of chance, be sure to sign up for the “World-Famous” LFNW raffle; we’ve donated a few
      bigger-ticket items there as well, and again, all funds support LFNW.</para>

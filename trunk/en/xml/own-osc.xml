    <para>The <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference 2011</ulink> team is
      happy to announce the partners for this year’s conference. Aside from sponsoring, there are
      contributions in terms of sessions, media coverage and network bandwidth. Let’s look at what
      our sponsors contribute, what sessions they’ll present and thank them for their support!

    <para>Disclaimer: the next paragraphs may sound presumptuous, but they're not. I swear.</para>
    <para>It has occurred to me, time and time again, that some people consider others as semi-gods.
      People who are highly active e.g. in open source projects, and are sometimes even regarded for
      their work. Well, it sucks.</para>
    <para>I know that this has happened to me a few times (being seen as a semi-god, that is), and I
      hate it. Not only does it not have any ground for being, we're just folks like everyone else,
      and while hard and good work should be appreciated, and while a simple "thank you" is way too
      rare and rewarding, taking it to that level is a very-bad-thing (tm) (...)</para>

    <para>It's been quite a while since I wrote a decent blog and it might be a while longer until I
      really get to it. I do have a lot to write about, however. First about the Community
      Leadership Summit - the notes of which I'd like to turn into a few blogs. Second, the Desktop
      Summit, which was awesome. And third my trip to Taiwan. Finally the upcoming openSUSE
      conference which is going to be awesome. But let me get the most important stuff out of the
      way first. (...)</para>

    <para>Among other things, the openSUSE project is about “having a lot of fun”. In that spirit we
      would like to add a bit of diversion and an extra incentive for everyone to register and
      attend the openSUSE conference.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Join the Drone On! contest and have a lot of fun.</emphasis></para>
    <para>We’ve purchased an <ulink url="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/">AR
      Drone</ulink>, small flying aircraft which can be controlled by a computer or mobile phone
      over wifi, to be given away at the openSUSE Conference. There is an open sourced SDK for
      Linux. The SDK site provides the software and shows how to guide the drone from a Linux
      workstation; with a console to show the drone operating parameters. Let’s get it up and
      running on openSUSE for the fun of it! (...)</para>

    <para>I was asked the other day "What do you expect from the openSUSE Conference?" The simple
      answer is I only expect to have fun. Seriously, I expect nothing more, nothing less. I hope
      for a whole lot more, but I certainly don't expect it.</para>
    <para>This may sound somewhat silly, but in all honesty that's how I feel. This conference (as
      are most others) is a great way to meet the people you interact with online, there's something
      satisfying to be able to replace the digital person with a real flesh and blood person. You
      can thank someone in a real sincere way with a gift (could be a pint or something else) or
      slap them and let your anger out. Digital is pretty good, but having the physical is always
      better once in a while :-D</para>

      time flies by and I have yet only received very few keys, I thought it might be a good idea to
      talk a little bit about what this whole thing is about and why you should participate.

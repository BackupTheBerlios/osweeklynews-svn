    <para>The <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference 2011</ulink> team is
      happy to announce the partners for this year’s conference. Aside from sponsoring, there are
      contributions in terms of sessions, media coverage and network bandwidth. Let’s look at what
      our sponsors contribute, what sessions they’ll present and thank them for their support!

    <para>So there is the <ulink url="http://www.socialdesktop.org/bretzn/">cool Bretzn
        project</ulink> which was about creating a plugin for IDE's to compile and publish code via
      the <ulink url="http://openbuildservice.org">Open Build Service</ulink> and the <ulink
        url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services">Open
        Collaboration Services</ulink> and then letting the user install, rate and comment on apps
      via a desktop client. (...)</para>

    <para>We will meet there and can discuss ICC colour management for the openSUSE distribution,
      KDE and Qt. </para>
    <para>Sebastian Oliva will be there too. I hope we can hack together a Oyranos connection to his
      newly created ICC DB. The ICC DB project, done during GSoC 2011, shall be used to search for
      ICC profiles by terms of colour device configurations. This means a printer can obtain a
      fitting ICC profile for a special driver without the need to have all the canned profiles
      packaged. Independent vendors can easily upload their ICC data and get their optimised profile
      selected automatically - if all works. Sebastian and Joseph Simon have done fair bits to get
      there in a clean way, without hacking the whole system. (...)</para>

    <para>Among other things, the openSUSE project is about “having a lot of fun”. In that spirit we
      would like to add a bit of diversion and an extra incentive for everyone to register and
      attend the openSUSE conference.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Join the Drone On! contest and have a lot of fun.</emphasis></para>
    <para>We’ve purchased an <ulink url="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/">AR
      Drone</ulink>, small flying aircraft which can be controlled by a computer or mobile phone
      over wifi, to be given away at the openSUSE Conference. There is an open sourced SDK for
      Linux. The SDK site provides the software and shows how to guide the drone from a Linux
      workstation; with a console to show the drone operating parameters. Let’s get it up and
      running on openSUSE for the fun of it! (...)</para>

      >Andrew Wafaa: What the openSUSE Conference means to me</ulink></title>
    <para>I was asked the other day "What do you expect from the openSUSE Conference?" The simple
      answer is I only expect to have fun. Seriously, I expect nothing more, nothing less. I hope
      for a whole lot more, but I certainly don't expect it.</para>
    <para>This may sound somewhat silly, but in all honesty that's how I feel. This conference (as
      are most others) is a great way to meet the people you interact with online, there's something
      satisfying to be able to replace the digital person with a real flesh and blood person. You
      can thank someone in a real sincere way with a gift (could be a pint or something else) or
      slap them and let your anger out. Digital is pretty good, but having the physical is always
      better once in a while :-D</para>

      time flies by and I have yet only received very few keys, I thought it might be a good idea to
      talk a little bit about what this whole thing is about and why you should participate.

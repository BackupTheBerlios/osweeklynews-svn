        Conference 2011</ulink></title>
    <para>Just like at last years conference, this years openSUSE conference will also feature a
      keysigning party, read on to find out how to participate and what to do. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">What is a Keysigning Party (KSP) </emphasis></para>
    <para>A key signing party is a get-together of people who use the PGP encryption system with the
      purpose of allowing those people to sign each others keys. Key signing parties serve to extend
      the web of trust to a great degree. Key signing parties also serve as great opportunities to
      discuss the political and social issues surrounding strong cryptography, individual liberties,
      individual sovereignty, and even implementing encryption technologies or perhaps future work
      on free encryption software. (...)</para>

        Hrušecký: openSUSE Conference 2011 – SaX3</ulink></title>
    <para>Yet another advertisement for openSUSE Conference 2011. Something I’ll be participating in
      as well. But this time, all the glory belongs to <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/05/people-of-opensuse-manu-gupta/">Manu Gupta</ulink>.
      I’ll be just helping out. We will have together presentation about SaX3. Have you already
      heard about SaX3? If not,continue reading.</para>
    <para>SaX2 was X configuration tool. It was using xorg.conf file and it allowed people to set
      various X properties in GUI. It was a user friendly way how to set up Xorg. But X developers
      made automatic configuration much better and xorg.conf file obsolete. They replaced it with
      something much better – configuration directory xorg.conf.d. You can place just snippets of
      original xorg.conf file in there to override some properties. It’s much better,
      butýunfortunatelyýit also made SaX2 obsolete. And even though automatic configuration is
      great, there still people that want to tweak just a few details. These people missed SaX2. One
      of the GSoC projects was to create SaX3 that will be aware of xorg.conf.d directory, respect
      it and would create just the necessary snippets. So your X configuration will stay as simple
      as possible, but you’ll also have possibility to configure it easily from GUI.</para>
    <para>Manu started working on this project. He had to learn a lot of new things, but he put a
      lot of effort into that and in the end, there is completely new SaX3. It uses <ulink
        url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libyui/">libyui</ulink>ýfor GUI toolkits abstraction.
      It is able to run as Qt, GTK or even ncurses application. It uses <ulink
        url="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</ulink> to parse xorg.conf.d files and during the summer
      even the Augeas Xorg lens was improved to support things that were needed. During the SaX3
      talk, you will learn, what SaX3 can do for you, how it works and also a little bit about
      interesting technologies beneath.</para>
    <para>If you are eager to see, what it already can do, you can check <ulink
        url="http://sysbytes.wordpress.com/tag/sax/">Manu’s blog about SaX3</ulink> and especially

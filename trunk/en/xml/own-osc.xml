  <title>openSUSE Conference 2011</title>
  <blockquote>
    <title><ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/osc11/">openSUSE Conference
      2011</ulink></title>
    <para>The third openSUSE Conference, <emphasis role="bold">osc11</emphasis>, kicks off on
      <emphasis role="bold">Sunday September 11</emphasis>, 2011 in <emphasis role="bold"
        >Nuremberg, Germany</emphasis>. Under the motto <emphasis role="bold">RWX</emphasis> all
      Free and Open Source Software enthusiasts are invited to come together for four days
      to<emphasis role="bold"> learn</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">hack</emphasis> and to
      <emphasis role="bold">have a lot of fun</emphasis>. The program will cover a variety topics
      with an emphasis on interaction between participants. The conference is <emphasis role="bold"
        >free of charge and open to anyone!</emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">OSC – The annual meeting of the community</emphasis></para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/community.png"
      width="50%"/></para>
    <para>The conference is the yearly get-together of the openSUSE community to give its people a
      chance to meet face to face, talk to and inspire each other. Having the chance to chat on the
      hallway, to quickly throw some ideas together on a whiteboard or to watch over each others
      shoulders while hacking can easily substitute endless chat sessions, thousand-mail threads on
      a mailing list and tiresome telephone calls. Being together in one room, even in this day and
      age, beats every other collaboration method and is what forges cohesion and friendships. That
      is why the openSUSE Project tries to get together this conference every year for its
      contributors. But not only for them, the conference is also for anyone using, working with or
      taking advantage of the project. No matter if you use our technology, if you are one of our
      many friends from free and open source upstream projects or if you contribute to another
      GNU/Linux distribution this conference is for you.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Find more information about the conference, the program and the
      location at<ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org"
        >http://conference.opensuse.org</ulink></emphasis></para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Program – Everybody has to read, write and
      execute</emphasis></para>
    <para>Last year, the conference had the motto <ulink
      url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/?p=5223">‘Collaboration Across Borders’</ulink> and
      brought together an international crowd from many communities. This year we shift our
      attention a bit deeper, aiming for hands-on discussions to get work done. Smaller, more
      focused meetings with a strong “read-write” attitude are at the core of the conference. Hence
      the subtitle of <emphasis role="bold">RWX^3</emphasis>, commonly known as the UNIX acronym for
      “Read, Write, Execute” – three times, for you, your community and the rest of the
      world!</para>
    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/intro.png"
      width="40%"/></para>
    <para>The highlights, like every year, are the keynotes that kick of each day. This year our
      community manager Jos, kernel hacker Greg KH and Michael Miller, marketing vice president of
      SUSE will give the honors. Of course the general program also has a lot of highlights in the
      distribution, community and technology tracks.</para>
    <para>Our distribution is, naturally, one of the topics which receives a lot of focus at our
      conference. Learn from Stefan Seyfried how to run the coolest bleeding edge stuff from the
      development tree while still retaining a reliable system that you can use for daily work. Let
      the Boosters teach you how to leave your own footprints in the distribution by becoming an
      contributor. Or get creative and work with other designers on the artwork for the desktops and
      applications 12.1 then and there.</para>
    <para>Also the “<emphasis role="italic">soft topics</emphasis>” in (Free-) software engineering
      will get their share of attention. Lydia Pintscher gives a workshop to discuss a number of
      topics that often cause social problems in technical communities and Henne Vogelsang
      introduces you to the basics of citizen journalism so you can improve your blogging skills. Or
      how about you help to shape the future of the Ambassador program in a workshop with Kostas
      Koudaras and Manu Gupta?</para>
    <para>Another cluster of topics will evolve around new technology that will bring FOSS and
      openSUSE forward. Robert Schweikert will give you an introduction to the basics of a cloud and
      an overview of the cloud projects in the Open Build Service. Brush up your debugging skills in
      a gdb workshop with Jýrgen Weigert or tag along for the journey of an I/O request through the
      kernel block layer with Suresh Jayaraman.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="italic">All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</emphasis>. So how
      about you visit the legen, wait for it…., dary social event on Monday at <ulink

    <para>After two years at the Berufsförderungswerk <ulink url="http://www.bfw-nuernberg.de/"/> in
      the outskirts of Nýrnberg, we have found a new location smack in the middle of the city. 10
      minutes away from the center of Nürnberg, in a former production area of the <emphasis
        role="bold">A</emphasis>llgemeine <emphasis role="bold">E</emphasis>lektricitýts-<emphasis
          role="bold">G</emphasis>esellschaft (<emphasis role="bold">AEG</emphasis>), the conference
      will be hosted by the <ulink url="http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/"><emphasis role="italic"
        >Zentrifuge</emphasis></ulink>. The Zentrifuge is a project that networks cultural
      interested and creative people in the region. The whole location has a special atmosphere of
      an old industrial plant, mixed with art and creativity. The perfect balance between work and
      play which we always aim for at the conference.</para>
    <para>Nürnberg with a population of 500,000 is the nucleus of the metropolitan region <emphasis
      role="italic">Franconia</emphasis> at the heart of Europe. Located in southern Germany, it
      is midway between Munich and Frankfurt and therefor easily reachable by road, rail and air. As
      a tourist city, known for the Nuremberg Trials and famous for the Christmas Market, Nürnberg
      has a very good tourist office which will help you with all your needs. The office also
      provides an <ulink
        url="http://tourismus.nuernberg.de/v06/no_cache/en/book-order/hotel-search-booking.html"
        >accommodation portal</ulink> on the web which should be your starting point to find a place
      to stay.</para>

      Conference Program and Keynote Speakers</ulink></title>
    <para>With our <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/osc11/">conference</ulink>,
      osc11, fast approaching (Have you <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/register"
        >registered</ulink> yet? If not, what are you waiting for?!), the excitement is building all
      over the project.</para>
    <para>Its quite some work to get to create a reasonable schedule for a conference. For osc we
      want to have a program with talks that interest all our visitors. And as visitors have a wide
      rage of skill levels we also want to balance the depth of the talks. Another thing we wanted
      to create are “<emphasis role="italic">gravitation centers</emphasis>” for our key topics
      within the program. Oh and we also seek out for new contributors with our conference. And all
      that needs to be sorted between rooms with different sizes, within the tracks you think are
      useful, with breaks, time to change rooms and so on and son on. Quite some parameters to take
      into account. That said, we are very happy that we can announce the schedule for the openSUSE
      Conference 2011 today!</para>
    <para><ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/timetable"
      >http://conference.opensuse.org/timetable</ulink></para>
    <para>We have scheduled more than 100 contributions in the four days of the conference. More
      than 50% of those are interactive like <emphasis role="italic">birds of a feather
        sessions</emphasis> (BoFs) and <emphasis role="italic">workshops</emphasis>, that is along
      with our motto RWXý which basically means that people should not only just listen, but also do
      things. (...)</para>

    <para>ts quite some work to get to a reasonable schedule for a FOSS conference done. You want a
      balanced program with topics where all visitors can find their interests in. Moreover the
      level of the talks must be taken care of as well as there should be gravitation centers for
      key topics within the community. As you usually also seek out for new community members with a
      conference, some topics which attract new people are also a very good idea. And all that needs
      to be sorted between rooms with different sizes, the times people can be around, the tracks
      you think are useful on the event and such. Quite some parameters to take into account. </para>
    <para>That said, I am very happy that we could issue the <ulink
        url="http://conference.opensuse.org/timetable">schedule</ulink> for the <ulink
        url="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference 2011</ulink> today.</para>
    <para>For conference organization there is tooling. Or should I say: Should be? Given the huge
      amount of FOSS conferences around, the number of free alternatives of conference organization
      systems is fairly small. We decided to go again with <ulink url="http://indico-software.org/"
        >Indico</ulink>, a python based system developed by <ulink
        url="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</ulink>. It provides support for the whole
      conference life cycle such as the call for abstracts, the internal judging process, the
      scheduling and such. With nice help from the developers we got it running smoothly and
      integrated. Sometimes the interface is not really straightforward, but finally its a very
      feature rich yet flexible tool that feels like it has managed some large (CERN) conferences
      already.(...)</para>

        Hrušecký: openSUSE Conference 2011 – SaX3</ulink></title>
    <para>Yet another advertisement for openSUSE Conference 2011. Something I’ll be participating in
      as well. But this time, all the glory belongs to <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/07/05/people-of-opensuse-manu-gupta/">Manu Gupta</ulink>.
      I’ll be just helping out. We will have together presentation about SaX3. Have you already
      heard about SaX3? If not,continue reading.</para>
    <para>SaX2 was X configuration tool. It was using xorg.conf file and it allowed people to set
      various X properties in GUI. It was a user friendly way how to set up Xorg. But X developers
      made automatic configuration much better and xorg.conf file obsolete. They replaced it with
      something much better – configuration directory xorg.conf.d. You can place just snippets of
      original xorg.conf file in there to override some properties. It’s much better,
      butýunfortunatelyýit also made SaX2 obsolete. And even though automatic configuration is
      great, there still people that want to tweak just a few details. These people missed SaX2. One
      of the GSoC projects was to create SaX3 that will be aware of xorg.conf.d directory, respect
      it and would create just the necessary snippets. So your X configuration will stay as simple
      as possible, but you’ll also have possibility to configure it easily from GUI.</para>
    <para>Manu started working on this project. He had to learn a lot of new things, but he put a
      lot of effort into that and in the end, there is completely new SaX3. It uses <ulink
        url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libyui/">libyui</ulink>ýfor GUI toolkits abstraction.
      It is able to run as Qt, GTK or even ncurses application. It uses <ulink
        url="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</ulink> to parse xorg.conf.d files and during the summer
      even the Augeas Xorg lens was improved to support things that were needed. During the SaX3
      talk, you will learn, what SaX3 can do for you, how it works and also a little bit about
      interesting technologies beneath.</para>
    <para>If you are eager to see, what it already can do, you can check <ulink
        url="http://sysbytes.wordpress.com/tag/sax/">Manu’s blog about SaX3</ulink> and especially

        Favorite Little Games</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>"Little games" is a term I use to describe those that are quick to start, easy to play,
      and quick to exit. These are the ones that usually come installed by default with most Linux
      distributions. Some have GNOME and KDE counterparts, but all are fun. Here are a few of my
      favorites.</para>
    <para>1. <emphasis role="bold">KMahjongg</emphasis></para>
    <para>KMahjongg is basically a tile matching game. It really doesn't require any specialized
      skills. In fact, it really only requires reasonable eyesight and the ability to click a mouse.
      The object is to clear the board by clicking matching tiles until all are removed. It bears no
      real connection to the ancient Chinese tile game of the same name, which as I understand it,
      actually plays much like our classic card game Rummy. KMahjongg is the version that ships with
      KDE, but I'm just almost sure there is a version for GNOME. But it's a great time-killer with
      each game taking about five or 10 minutes to complete. Your score can be saved at the end of
      each board, and you can save your game at any point and come back to it later.</para>

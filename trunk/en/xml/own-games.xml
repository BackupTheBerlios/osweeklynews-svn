    </title>
    <para><ulink url="http://wildfiregames.com/">Wildfire Games</ulink>, an international group of
      volunteer developers, is making progress towards version 1.0 of its open source cross-platform
      real-time strategy (RTS) game, <ulink url="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/">0A.D.</ulink> with
      the release of a <ulink url="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/page.php?p=14442">seventh alpha
        version</ulink>, named "Geronium". Contributor Aviv Sharon told The H that the team aren't
      in a rush to complete a fully-playable version, however, they do "expect to reach a version
      1.0 within a year or so" adding that "unlike some open source projects, we do want to have a
      'finished' version of the game for our own sense of closure".</para>
    <para>Open sourced two years ago in July 2009, the game is similar to Microsoft's <ulink
        url="http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/">Age of Empires</ulink> in that users create
      and build civilisations and must defend them against their enemies. The game focuses on the
      years 500BC to AD500 and includes six unique civilisations and several multi-player modes.

        Reed: Linux Gaming: OpenClonk</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>Until recently, I had presumed that a Clonk was the sound that my hard drive made just
      before I realized that I hadn't backed it up properly. However, in this case, a Clonk is a
      tiny chap who can jump, climb and fire weapons in the service of reaching his
      goal. OpenClonk runs on Linux and is the latest in a series of side-view platform games that
      started life as a DOS shareware series.</para>
    <para><inlinegraphic
        fileref="http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/u1013687/openclonk2_resize.jpg"
      /></para>
    <para>Although, superficially, <ulink url="http://www.openclonk.org/">OpenClonk</ulink> could be
      classified as a platform game, the pace is thoughtful rather than breakneck. It borrows its
      control system from first person shooters, and the familiar WASD key cluster is teamed with
      mouse control for movement and aiming respectively.</para>
    <para>The graphics make use of 3D hardware rendering even though the view is strictly side-on
      and 2D. Although it makes use of 3D acceleration, it doesn't need a powerhouse graphics card
      to run, and it rendered perfectly well on my Core Duo with integrated Intel graphics chipset.
      I suspect it would have run even more smoothly with a lesser processor and a more powerful,
      dedicated graphics card.</para>

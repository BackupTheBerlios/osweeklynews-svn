    </title>
    <para>Here’s a small summary of the 10th (coding) week. This week I spentmost of my time with
      working on the package working copy class’commit method. This also involved some code
      refactoring.Basically commit and update are handled as “transactions” and allrelevant
      transaction data is stored in a single xml file(pkg/.osc/_transaction/state). This way an
      update/commit is more orless an atomic operation.</para>
    <para>For more information have a look at [1] (class XMLTransactionState+ subclasses and
      commit/update method).</para>
    <para>TODO:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>add update and commit methods for the project class</para>

    <para>It’s nice to write to you again. I’ve been having a 10 days vacation (that’s why there was
      no week 8 report), enjoyed it and now I’m back with fresh forces.</para>
    <para>This short (started slowly on Tuesday) week’s activity regards:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>almost fixing a bug that prevents my PackageKit software-center from prime time:

        <listitem>
          <para>starting work on the openSUSE integration (the corresponding Distro class, removal
            of forgotten apt related imports, dependency identification and testing).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>I will continue work on this side and <emphasis role="italic">hope</emphasis> that by the
      end of the next week, will have everything working and up for testing in openSUSE.</para>
    <para>NB: I will have to provide for testing a trunk version of pygobject since a release is
      delayed by another awaited merge;</para>

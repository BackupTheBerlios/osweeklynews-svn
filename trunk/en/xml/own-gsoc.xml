        My GSoC Project – SaX3</ulink></title>
    <para>Well, SaX off course needs no introduction for old time openSUSE and SUSE Users and
      certainly lots of people want it to be back on openSUSE. My proposal for Google Summer Of Code
      for SaX3 was selected and my mentor will be Michal Hrušecký. Now I will tell about the little
      interesting things on which I will be working on and some of the more interesting things later
      on at the end of the blog post. </para>
    <para>SaX as most of on planet SUSE knows stands for SUSE Advanced X Configuration Tool, but for
      others lets say we want to have a Graphical Front End for Xorg.conf.d, so that we can easily
      configure our hardware too. The specific bits on which I will be focusing would be keyboard,
      mouse, touchpad and offcourse whats SaX without a good screen configuration tool like monitor,
      yes we will support that. One of the interesting features that SaX3 will support that it will
      have a graphical UI for ncurses mode even, so even if your X is not functioning, you dont need
      to remember a lot of command line commands.</para>

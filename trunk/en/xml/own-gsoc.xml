    <para>Recently I have found out that my GSoC proposal was accepted. Therefore, I thought that it
      would be nice to introduce myself and the project I will work on, to the community.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">A few words about me</emphasis></para>
    <para>My name is Christos “mpounta” Bountalis and I am slightly over 24, I live in <ulink
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamis_Island">Salamis</ulink> a small island near Athens
      in Greece. I am currently in my final year studying towards a BSc degree in Computer Science.
      I spend my free time programming, listening to music, tweaking my system, hanging out with
      friends and occasionally playing soccer. I consider GSoC to be a great opportunity for me to
      join the openSUSE developers community in a more introductory way. and I plan to take
      advantage of it <inlinemediaobject>

    <para>Soon we'll all hear the news on the students accepted to Google Summer of Code. I'm
      excited and I'm sure so are a lot of students! </para>
    <para>Once the news is in, it is time to start getting to know your mentor, getting your
      development environment up and starting to code. To help students, mentors and admins, let me

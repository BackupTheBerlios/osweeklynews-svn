    <para>Exciting news for the project this week. After solving the problem with the comments and
      the tree representation of the sysconfig files in Augeas, there was a big leap in the
      project’s progress. By having test data and through debugging i was able to complete the match
      algorithm.The program is now able to traverse through two trees / files, make the necessary
      matches between the nodes of these two trees and provide the appropriate information to the
      later stages. That of merging.</para>

    <para>This week I’ve been working on finishing up the ToDo Lists, which did entail writing a new
      Item Delegate for the list as the previous method of checking which widget had been clicked
      was less than optimal!. I have finished the ToDo List and it will hopefully be merged on
      Monday into an experimental branch that I can go through and ensure that everything works as
      expected. This will then all be pulled together as a possible version 1.0 of Entomologist,
      which is great news!.</para>
    <para>I am currently researching possibilities for integrating Cloud Services into the ToDo List
      and I plan on targeting an iCal/WebDAV compatible format export to begin with. Once this basic
      step is in place I can then look at integrating with various web services and generic
      iCal/WebDAV support for servers that use these.</para>
    <para>This all leads on to how long I have left of my GSoC, which by my count is 5 weeks(!) of
      GSoC Time,but I would like to stick to the soft pencils down date as much as possible so the
      final week can be spent ensuring everything works properly. I want to look at the addition of
      QML after I’ve integrated some Cloud Sync aspects as I think this would be a really excellent
      feature to have.</para>
    <para>Here’s a screenshot of the ToDo List on OS X Lion (Which also shows that nothing has to be
      done to Entomologist’s code base to make it compatible):</para>

        >http://redache.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/midterm-report-things-completed-so-far/</ulink> and
      the text below. I really recommend reading the blog post as it has screenshots of everything
      :).</para>
    <para>This report is a summary of all the work that I've completed so far for my Summer of Code
      and what is to come :).</para>
    <para>Porting Entomologist to Windows and Mac OS X:Entomologist works mostly flawlessly on Mac
      OS X. Windows was an awkward platform to port for and it still doesn't function as well as it
      could but once we hit version 1.0 a lot of the problems can be addressed.</para>
    <para>Tabbed Interface for selecting Trackers:</para>
    <para>This took a few weeks to complete as it was awkward to get everything to work correctly, I
      also had the learning curve/understanding new code slowing me down whilst doing it. Overall
      I'm pretty happy with how it looks and how it works.</para>
    <para>New Comments Dialog:</para>
    <para>Next on the list was creating a New Comments Dialog. The goal was to make it easier to
      select a bug and see the comments and add new comments for that specific bug. The dialog works
      by either highlighting a bug in the table and hitting Ctrl + Shift + N(Cmd + Shift + N on a
      Mac) or by clicking the new comments button in the expanded comments dialog. If no bug is
      highlighted it defaults to opening the first bug in the list.</para>
    <para>ToDo Lists:</para>
    <para>This is probably the most helpful feature I've worked on throughout the project. It has
      been a bit of a learning curve and I think I'm starting to 'Get' QT and I can definitely see
      why QT is usually classed as better than GTK. This feature still isn't finished but it is
      nearly all there and I'm currently working on the mechanism to add new ToDoLists. Once that's
      completed the first basic iteration will be there and it should be useful in that
      state.</para>
    <para>Post Midterm Plans:</para>
    <para>Post midterm I want to add cloud sync to the ToDoLists so you can sync the items to
      whichever tracker you feel is appropriate. This should help in organising data and
      recording milestones through bugs :). I think I'll start by having it export to
      calendar formats that can be read by normal desktop viewers and they can handle the sync. But
      the plan is to add that service integration to entomologist itself.</para>
    <para>After that work is completed I will look at how we can integrate QML into Entomologist so
      the trackers that it supports can be extended by using QML. This would take a lot of work away
      from Matt as he won't have to add new trackers, the users that want them can use QML to define
      them and they can submit them as an extension :). I think this is the best way to manage most
      bug trackers as there are a lot of different ones out there.</para>
    <para>So that's it for the work completed so far. Hopefully at the end we'll reach version 1.0
      of Entomologist and move on with adding shiny new things :).</para>

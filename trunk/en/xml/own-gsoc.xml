    <para>Several students proposed this year to specific colour management themes. Unfortunately
      not all could be accepted for the stipends, even though the quality of the proposals where
      generally high for the themes and response was very lifely. The mentors made their decision
      and picked the following three proposals and students. </para>
    <para>Yiannis Belias will continue the last years project: "API stabilization for Oyranos Colour
      Management System II" for <ulink url="http://opensuse.sf.net/">OpenICC</ulink> We have seen
      good progress and quite usable code during the last year period. Still there is lots to do to
      integrate and finish the code transformation. (...)</para>

    <para>Soon we'll all hear the news on the students accepted to Google Summer of Code. I'm
      excited and I'm sure so are a lot of students! </para>
    <para>Once the news is in, it is time to start getting to know your mentor, getting your
      development environment up and starting to code. To help students, mentors and admins, let me
      echo a <ulink url="http://blog.lydiapintscher.de/2011/04/23/gsoc-dos-and-donts/">post by Lydia

    <para>I’m now focusing on the gtk3 part, and also documenting things around. Packaging has

    <para>From now on, I will focus a lot on fixing issues and polishing the UI, specially the
      touchpad one and yes offcourse clean some code. I have moved to code.google.com but the
      transition is not complete yet.</para>

        libYUI Ported</ulink></title>
    <para>As most of you reading this post would know, separating libYUI was one of the topics for
      GSoC 2011 by openSUSE. Over the last three months, a lot of work has gone into the project. As
      the deadline approaches, we am happy to announce that libYUI is an independent
      framework!</para>
    <para>Let me summarize the changes that have taken place over the last three months. For
      starters, libYUI is available over a range of platforms. Major platforms like Fedora, Ubuntu
      and Debian have ready made binaries available at OBS -<ulink
        url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/nbprashanth/">
        http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/nbprashanth/</ulink>. Recently, Michal
      Hrušecký even ported the library to Gentoo! – <ulink
        url="http://nbprashanth.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/libyui-ported/michal.hrusecky.net/2011/08/libyui-in-gentoo/"
        >michal.hrusecky.net/2011/08/libyui-in-gentoo/</ulink>. The source has been completely
      detached from SUSE-centric technologies. So if binaries are not available for your distro,
      don’t fret. You can always download the source and install from – <ulink

        Dani: Test Suite for btrfs - Weekly Update</ulink></title>
    <para>This is a summary of the work that I did in the last week.(Week # 10) </para>
    <para>The test no. 256 was modified to add support for memory mapped i/o operations. Thus, now
      in the test the files are created using both direct i/o as well as memory mapped i/o. </para>
    <para>A new test, test no. 257 was added which handles large file creation and modification of
      upto 1GB. </para>
    <para>Both the tests 256 and 257 were modified to handle any snapshot supported generic file
      system. You can find the latest made changes <ulink

    <para>This week I’ve been working at getting Remember the Milk integration finished. Right now
      Lists can be added to Remember the Milk and I’m in the middle of implementing update/delete
      functionality. </para>
    <para>It has been a hard week as I’ve never had to use a web based API before and the Remember
      the Milk one doesn’t seem like the easiest to get to grips with (its beta form is probably
      indicative of this). The main time consumer now is getting the update/delete functionality
      which isn’t an issue with Remember The Milks API but one of trying to find the right solution
      that is generic enough to be used with other services so I avoid large chunks of code that are
      specific to a single service.</para>
    <para>For the final week I will continue working on integrating Remember the Milk,Google
      Calendar and WebDAV and over the remaining 10 days I will try and get these services fully
      integrated. The final week of GSoC will hopefully be spent on preparing a 1.0 release and any
      code addition will be kept to a minimum (with a hope that there won’t be any outside of
      merging). </para>

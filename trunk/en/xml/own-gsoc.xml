        >Michal Hrusecky: GSoC 2011 Ideas – Karma plugin for openSUSE Connect</ulink></title>
    <para>This post is about one idea for GSoC 2011 regarding openSUSE Connect. I already <ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2010/08/ideas-about-karma-in-opensuse-connect/">wrote about
        it</ulink> some time ago, but now is time to elaborate a little bit more.</para>
    <para>First of all, let me state, that I already found a qualified student, that wants to work
      on this idea and that has also some good suggestions. So I’m not searching for a student with
      this post, but I want to share with you the goals of this project and why I think it is
      important.</para>
    <para>Let’s start again with what it is all about. We as a openSUSE Project have many
      contributors. People provide not only code, but they write documentation on our wiki, report
      bugs, organize release parties, organize booths at conferences and much more. Obviously we
      should make their effort recognized by public. Usual way how to do it is to assign so called
      karma points. Basically concept works like that for every contribution you receive some
      points. And then, anytime you appear somewhere, everybody can see how skilled you are. This
      works well on forums, but we have many different people and many different kinds of
      activities. And we want project wide karma somehow.</para>
    <para>So basic idea of this project is to create different kinds of karma and collect as many
      information as possible automatically. So we will have wiki karma that will grow with every
      wiki page edit. We will have marketing karma growing bigger with every tweet and blog post.
      Packager karma getting bigger with every change submitted to the openSUSE. So this project
      will be not only about displaying and managing karma points but also about collecting
      statistics from various different services.</para>
    <para>One thing that I wanted implemented was ability for group moderators to reward group
      members for extraordinary work a little bit extra. So for example if some KDE developer will
      fix really tough bug, KDE people can give him some extra points. But allocating these extra
      points will not be easy and will definitely need some more thoughts. Main trouble will be how
      to allocate points that group can redistribute.</para>
    <para>Other feature I wanted to have was having means how individuals can reward others whose
      work they appreciate. My original idea was to let people send around their own Karma points.
      But I was pointed out, that this might not be a good idea. There are few reasons why. First
      trouble is that people will get karma points of different type than they should have.
      Ambassador will send some karma points to the great developer and shy developer could earn
      many marketing points this way even though he prefers to be locked down in the basement. Other
      problem is that people that didn’t contributed yet or thanked a lot might not have anything
      left to show how did they liked the work. So other idea proposed by Kartik was using some
      general thanks you button. While thinking about it, it makes some sense to create separate
      karma type for that as well.</para>
    <para>And what to do with karma point once you have some? It should be certainly displayed in
      the river on the connect so others will know that you did something. But there should be
      possibility to also use them somehow. Obviously there need to be a banner displaying amount of
      them that you can put on your web. So your visitors can see how great contributor you are.
      Other thing that I was thinking about was to create some badges for your avatars that you can
      buy. Or even allow third party applications to use them somehow using API, so you could buy
      things, but that sounds like a distant future…</para>
    <para>So there is a lot of work to do and student who applied has even some more ideas, so I
      think if this project will get selected, openSUSE Connect will be much more fun <inlinemediaobject>

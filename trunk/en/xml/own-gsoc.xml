    <para>Today the official coding period of GSoC 2011 ends. It’s been a four months journey, with
      challenges, failures and achievements, but nevertheless fun :-) . </para>
    <para>You may be wondering what is the status of my project; here it goes: current version of
      Software Center can be tested in openSUSE Factory; it can populate its database with data from
      an AppStream XML; it shows application information (fetched from the package manager); it
      installs and removes software, in the same friendly manner the ubuntu does (showing progress,
      handling dependencies). </para>
    <para>Moreover, my patches to <ulink url="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=652256"
        >gobject-introspection</ulink>, <ulink
        url="https://gitorious.org/packagekit/packagekit/commit/c2016d35d33a03c481fd0586af26426184dfd758"
        >PackageKit</ulink> and obviously <ulink
        url="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~software-store-developers/software-center/trunk/revision/2146"
        >software-center</ulink>, are all upstream and released; kudos to the project managers and
      the community for helping me get them there.</para>

    <para>Actually this report is 2 days late, those who have already added my repository and
      updated it should have the sax3-touchpad module. </para>

    <para>From now on, I will focus a lot on fixing issues and polishing the UI, specially the
      touchpad one and yes offcourse clean some code. I have moved to code.google.com but the
      transition is not complete yet.</para>

        libYUI Ported</ulink></title>
    <para>As most of you reading this post would know, separating libYUI was one of the topics for
      GSoC 2011 by openSUSE. Over the last three months, a lot of work has gone into the project. As
      the deadline approaches, we am happy to announce that libYUI is an independent
      framework!</para>
    <para>Let me summarize the changes that have taken place over the last three months. For
      starters, libYUI is available over a range of platforms. Major platforms like Fedora, Ubuntu
      and Debian have ready made binaries available at OBS -<ulink
        url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/nbprashanth/">
        http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/nbprashanth/</ulink>. Recently, Michal
      Hrušecký even ported the library to Gentoo! – <ulink

        >michal.hrusecky.net/2011/08/libyui-in-gentoo/</ulink>. The source has been completely
      detached from SUSE-centric technologies. So if binaries are not available for your distro,
      don’t fret. You can always download the source and install from – <ulink

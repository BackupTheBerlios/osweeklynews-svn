        >Christos Bountalis: About GSoC proposal “fillup-ng”</ulink></title>
    <para>Recently I have found out that my GSoC proposal was accepted. Therefore, I thought that it
      would be nice to introduce myself and the project I will work on, to the community.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">A few words about me</emphasis></para>
    <para>My name is Christos “mpounta” Bountalis and I am slightly over 24, I live in <ulink
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamis_Island">Salamis</ulink> a small island near Athens
      in Greece. I am currently in my final year studying towards a BSc degree in Computer Science.
      I spend my free time programming, listening to music, tweaking my system, hanging out with
      friends and occasionally playing soccer. I consider GSoC to be a great opportunity for me to
      join the openSUSE developers community in a more introductory way. and I plan to take
      advantage of it <inlinemediaobject>

      Center</ulink></title>
    <para>Hi everyone,</para>
    <para>Just a quick announce that I will be working this summer as a GSoC student, for the
      openSUSE Project. My mentor will be <ulink url="http://vuntz.net">Vincent Untz</ulink>, the so
      called <quote>father of GNOME 3</quote>

    <para>What I’m aiming to do is modify Ubuntu Software Center to use PackageKit (an universal
      package management toolkit) as a installation backend, and also integrate it with the
      AppStream initiative (a cross-distro project for making software installation easier).</para>
    <para>My full proposal can be read <ulink
        url="http://swarm.cs.pub.ro/%7Ealexef/gsoc/proposal.html">here (fixed)</ulink>. Feedback and
      suggestions are, as always, appreciated.</para>
    <para>I would like to thank <ulink url="http://www.rosedu.org/gsoc">ROSEdu</ulink> (which I am a
      member of) for the support <inlinemediaobject>

          >Linux.com/Jack Wallen: Collaborate Using LibreOffice Writer Changes and
        Comments</ulink></title>
      <para>Being a writer, I often have to collaborate with other writers or editors on an
        assignment or book. Because of this, there is a need for collaboration tools within my word
        processor. LibreOffice offers such tools for the writer, editor, student, or teacher. These
        tools are Changes and Comments and they make the process of collaboration within a
        LibreOffice Writer document so much easier. </para>
      <para>But don't think these tools are only good for collaboration. If you want simple revision
        control, if you want to see how your document is evolving or progressing, or if you have a
        need to keep notes within your document, you too can take advantage of these tools. But how
        are they used? Let's dive in and experience the LibreOffice collaboration tools.

      <para>The read command is designed to read and then use in the script input from the user. The

        will store one line of input from the user in one or more variables. The read command is
        valuable as it is a major way to input information into a shell script. Lines are read into
        the script with standard input and split via the $IFS variable. This stands for internal
        field separator. The first word is assigned the first variable, the second word the second
        variable, etc. (...)</para>

        does not have a desktop environment. Fortunately, VirtualBox comes with a tool called
        VBoxHeadless that allows you to connect to the virtual machines over a remote desktop
        connection, so there&apos;s no need for the VirtualBox GUI. (...)</para>

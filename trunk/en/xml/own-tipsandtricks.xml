      </title>
      <para>This tutorial shows how you can set up an <ulink url="http://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE 11.4</ulink> desktop that is a full-fledged replacement for a Windows desktop, i.e. that
        has all the software that people need to do the things they do on their Windows desktops.
        The advantages are clear: you get a secure system without DRM restrictions that works even
        on old hardware, and the best thing is: all software comes free of charge.</para>
      <para>I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system. There are
        many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take. I do not issue any guarantee
        that this will work for you! (...)</para>

To begin with, remember that there are two kinds of graphics you can add to your layout. You can have photos, generally taken from a digital camera, downloaded, or bought on some website. Photos will generally be stored in JPEG files, but you can also find PNG, TIFF, or many other file formats. The second kind of graphics is vector drawings such as logos and maps. They are computer-made drawings and are stored as EPS or SVG files. You will certainly need to work with both in most of your documents. (...)</para>

      <para>A number of years ago I wrote about the <ulink
          url="http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2007/02/merge-sort.html">Merge Sort</ulink>
        algorithm. One of the advantages of <emphasis role="italic">Merge Sort</emphasis> is that it
        is a stable sort, meaning that elements that compare as being equal remain in their original
        order after being sorted.</para>
      <para>Well, today I had need of employing a stable sorting routine for sorting elements by a
        ZIndex in <ulink url="http://www.moonlight-project.com">Moonlight</ulink>. Up until today,
        we had been using <emphasis role="italic">qsort()</emphasis> which, while not guaranteed to
        be a stable sort on any platform, happens to be implemented in <emphasis role="italic"
          >glibc</emphasis> as a stable sort except in out-of-memory conditions. Since we'd like
        Moonlight to work on platforms other than Linux+glibc (such as Mac OS or BSD), it has become
        important enough to implement properly.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Introduction</emphasis></para>
      <para>YaST has a module for the server and the client part of OpenLDAP (plus a very basic LDAP browser / editor).

</para>
      <para>On SLES11 we had the following problems regarding the use of the YaST module and OpenLDAP server configuration:

    </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Database version only to store the configuratio (cn=config).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>No way to set up any replication method or mode using this module.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>OpenLDAP modules available build in the SLAPD binary.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Then your choices in this SLES11 version:

    </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Use the configuration file /etc/openldap/slapd.conf but in this case, forget YaST for ever.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Use YaST to set up a basic OpenLDAP server then use an external tool to set up the rest.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If use of YaST only is mandatory, forget the replication.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>An RFE (Request For Enhancements) was created at this time, to be able to set up replication from the YaST module, on SLES11 SP1. They did it! So, letâ€™s check how it works.

</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis>: On SLES11 or SLES11 SP1, by playing with /etc/sysconfig/opendlap, you can use the configuration file (/etc/openldap/slapd.conf) to configure OpenLDAP server but in this case do not use YaST anymore. (...)</para>

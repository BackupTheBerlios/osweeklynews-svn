      </title>
      <para>OpeSUSE, like Fedora, doesn&apos;t support non-free/proprietary formats in the community version. So, if you want to use proprietary or restricted codecs you will have to install restricted formats. It&apos;s extremely easy using openSUSE KDE.

Just visit this <ulink url="http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_formats/12.1">page</ulink> and select the easier <ulink url="http://opensuse-community.org/codecs-kde.ymp">1-click</ulink> installation. (...)</para>

      <para>I had to struggled a bit to connect my HP Photosmart Prem c410 printer on openSUSE. Coming from Ubuntu, I was used to &apos;add printer&apos; button and just follow the click-next procedure.</para>
      <para>Under openSUSE it&apos;s a bit different. openSUSE 12.1 comes with HPLIP Tool which makes it easier to install and configure HP printers. If your printer is connected through the wireless (as was mine), you can set it up using this tool.</para>
      <para>HPLIP wants the user to be added to several groups (I learned that after 3 failed attempts, so I am saving your time). Before firing the HP Tool, go to YaST and click on &apos;User and Group Management Accounts&apos;. (...)</para>

      <para>There is a very tiny (extremely tiny, as tiny as a microbe) price you have to pay when you use a highly customizable desktop environment like KDE. I had issues with networking (which was more to do with my ignorance than KDE) under openSUSE KDE 12.1.</para>
      <para>While the live version showed the network icon in the tray, once I installed it on my desktop it was gone. There was no Internet.  I noticed this behavior only on the desktop, everything was fine on my laptop.</para>

      <para>This is my first blog post for the assignment “Development Tools” , so i could say that
        i am very happy with this matter!</para>
      <para>Well i use openSUSE Linux 12.1 and i am very proud of that! Sometimes i face problems
        like , lack of packages for programs, but this matter doesn’t mean that you cannot install
        the software you wish. In my case i installed Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo SR1) due to i have to use
        the <ulink url="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Marketplace</ulink>. Eclipse
        Marketplace offers a thousand of plug-ins and extra features available for Eclipse platform.
        It is a truth that i searched a lot in order to find a package or a “one-click install” file
        but the result was an installation of 3.6.2 version. As we all know in FLOSS always there is
        a way to overcome problems and also fix them. Furthermore as a developer i have to use the
          “<ulink

Since version 3.0.4, ISPConfig comes with full support for the nginx web server in addition to Apache, and this tutorial covers the setup of a server that uses nginx instead of Apache. ISPConfig 3 is a webhosting control panel that allows you to configure the following services through a web browser: nginx and Apache web server, Postfix mail server, MySQL, Dovecot POP3/IMAP, BIND or MyDNS nameserver, PureFTPd, SpamAssassin, ClamAV, and many more.</para>
      <para>If you want to use nginx instead of Apache with ISPConfig, please note that your nginx version must be at least 0.8.21, and you must install PHP-FPM as well. For CGI/Perl support, you must use fcgiwrap. This is all covered by this tutorial. (...)</para>

      <para>Yes, you can use Twitter for monitoring your server. I won&apos;t say that it is a complete monitoring solution nor I will ask you to throw away your existing monitoring mechanisms.

          >MakeUseOf/Yaara Lancet: Organize Your Research With The New Standalone Zotero</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Everyone in the world of research, and many people outside of it, knows that a good
        citation manager and <ulink
          url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-pdf-document-management-tools-organizing-research/"
          >PDF organizer</ulink> is a must if you want to keep track of all the papers you’ve read
        and accumulated. For the past two years, I’ve been using Zotero to organize my research for
        articles. Zotero is a <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/firefox/"
        >Firefox</ulink>add-on in which you can save citations and links to <ulink
          url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/pdf/">PDFs</ulink> and access them at any time.</para>
      <para>One of Zotero’s biggest cons is that it works only within Firefox. This means you have
        to be running Firefox and use it to save the articles you find. As long as I was using
        Firefox, this was not a big issue, but when I switched to <ulink
          url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/chrome/">Chrome</ulink> for a while, it became quite
        cumbersome. Not to speak of the fact that I had to load Firefox every time I wanted to look
        at my database (which can be a lengthy process at times).</para>
      <para>This is why I was delighted to find out that Zotero have come up with Standalone Zotero
        Alpha (Windows, Mac and Linux) and with Chrome and Safari connectors for it. Note that this
        project is still in alpha, so it is not perfect by any means. These new versions came out in
        February, so hopefully we’ll see some updates soon. Now let’s see what it can do to organize
        your research. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>Sometimes, especially on the command line, it happens that you delete a file or
        directory you didn't really plan to delete. A second after hit enter you realize what you
        have done, maybe you are fast enough to stop the deletion process and save some files, but
        in the most cases it's already to late, at least for some files.  If you have no or a too
        old backup you're screwed.</para>
      <para>If you use ext3/ext4 you may be able to recover the file with <ulink
          url="http://code.google.com/p/ext3grep/">ext3grep</ulink> or<ulink
          url="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">extundelete</ulink> with information from the
        file system journal if the content of the file wasn't already overwritten by new
        data. (...)</para>

      <para>The <ulink url="http://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program</ulink> (GIMP) is one of the most powerful image editing tools available. It is, effectively, the Photoshop of the open source world; and with that kind of title comes a level of power most never take advantage of. One feature that should be a must-use for all digital artists is the layer. Using layers not only makes work easier, it gives digital art more depth and more flexibility.</para>
      <para>What I want to do is to illustrate some of the more advanced methods for using layering in GIMP. Once these techniques have been mastered, creating and editing digital masterpieces will be so much easier. I will assume the basics of layers is understood (such as how to add, copy, and delete layers), so the 101-level layer steps will not be discussed.(...)</para>

      <para>In this tutorial we look at using images in a GUI environment.  One of the possible
        attributes which can be assigned to a Label or Button widget is an image.   You will surely
        have seen many buttons with images on them.   Every time you see a toolbar in a program,
        each of the images on it is itself on a button widget.  In order to do this tutorial though
        there are a couple of issues:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>first, you need to have images in the Python4kids directory we set up several
              tutorials ago.  You also need to start Python from within that directory.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>second, unless you install something called the Python Imaging Library (PIL),
              Python can only handle a few limited types of image file.  One of the file types which
              will work is .gif, which we will be using here. This tutorial<emphasis role="bold"
                >will not work</emphasis> with jpeg files.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>third, you need to have the gif files we’re going to use in your python for kids
              directory.</para>

      <para>Most Linux system administrators are familiar with sar for collecting system status data. However, there&apos;s a few ways that sar shows its age and doesn&apos;t quite live up to expectations.

      <para>The collectl utility was written by Mark Seger, and it is dual-licensed under the Artistic License and GNU General Public License (GPL).

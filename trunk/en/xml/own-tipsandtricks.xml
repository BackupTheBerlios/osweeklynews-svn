      <para>The Windows version of Firefox comes with a fancy menu button in the title bar. Linux doesn&apos;t have that exact feature, but you can come close. Shawn Powers shows us how.</para>

      <para>Learning find can seem daunting at first, but it is worth learning. There is no single more useful search tool for UNIX like systems. You could almost consider find a very primitive scripting language in itself as find can find the files you request and then perform tasks. (...)</para>

      <para>About a month ago, we were working on <ulink url="http://brmlab.cz/project/fluffyball"
          >the Fluffy Ball project</ulink> – a computer input device that can react to fondling and
        punching. Thanks to a nice idea on the brmlab mailing list, we use a microphone and process
        the noise coming from the ball’s scratchy stuffing and an embedded jingle. The sounds from
        the outside are almost entirely dampened by the stuffing and for a human, the noise of
        fondling and punching is easily distinguishable.</para>
      <para>It turns out that trivial spectrum-based rules can be used to achieve reasonably high
        detection accuracy for a computer too (especially when the user is allowed to “train” her
        input based on feedback); I had big plans to use ANN and all the nifty things I have learned
        in our AI classes, but it turned out to be simply an overkill. The input signal is
        transformed to a frequency spectrum (see box) using <ulink
          url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">real discrete
        FFT</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Sorry for the lame title. I was thinking the other day, about how awesome SSH is, and how it&apos;s probably one of the most crucial pieces of technology that I use every single day.

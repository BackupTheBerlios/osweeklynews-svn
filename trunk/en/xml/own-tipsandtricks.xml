      <para>A few months ago my father-in-law said that his company was renewing their computers.
        When I heard that some second-hand PCs were about to be available, I decided to take some of
        them, thinking that a few old PCs would not hurt when it comes to enlarging my home network
        and doing experiments with GNU/Linux. When my father-in-law asked if it would be possible to
        reformat one of those computers so that he could use it at his home, I jumped at the
        opportunity to bring another user to the world of GNU/Linux. A few days passed and he was a
        happy user of his new computer running Ubuntu, and he was enjoying his Firefox while he
        explored the web. I don’t know what other people think or usability studies say, but he said
        that he had no problem using the system and he was surprised that I did not have to install
        an anti-virus. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>On UNIX, GNU Screen is a utility that i cannot live without. I know many console users share the same point of view with me.</para>
      <para>What is GNU Screen? it is a terminal multiplexer and you can run multiple console-based applications simultaneously. The best part of it is that you can leave it running on remote machines and come back to pick up your console sessions. It’s like VNC or Remote Desktop but for UNIX console. As you know that on UNIX if you run something on a shell and you got disconnected from it then your sessions will also stop. All work will be gone. (...)</para>

        <ulink url="http://log.or.cz/?p=156">Petr Baudis: brmd: A Case for POE</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>In <ulink url="http://brmlab.cz/">brmlab</ulink>, we want to <ulink url="http://brmlab.cz/project/brmdoor">track</ulink> who is unlocking the space, whether
        someone is inside, have some good visual indicator that <ulink url="http://brmlab.cz/project/presentationcenter">live stream</ulink> is on air, and so
        on. In other words, we have an Arduino with some further hardware, and we want to show
        whatever is reported by the Arduino on IRC and <ulink url="http://nat.brmlab.cz/brmd/">web</ulink>, and provide some web-based control (open/closed status override) in the
        opposite direction too.</para>
      <para>What to use for a service (we call it brmd) that will bind all these interfaces
        together? It just needs a lot of boring frontends and simple state maintenance. </para>
      <para>It turns out that Perl’s <ulink url="http://poe.perl.org/">POE</ulink> framework is
        ideal for this – most of the code for IRC, HTTP and device read/write is already there, so
        you just grab the modules, slam them together and you have exactly what you need with
        minimal effort. Right?It turns out that there are caveats – basically, the idea is correct,
        aside of getting stuck on a single stupidity of mine, I’d have the whole thing put together
        in something like half an hour. Unfortunately, the moment you want robustness too, things
        are getting a lot more complex; to handle the device disappearing, IRC disconnections, not
        having HTTP socket fds leak away, etc., you suddenly need to either magically know what
        further modules to hook up or start exeting some manual effort. Still, I like how POE is
        making it so easy to give a simple state machine many input/output interfaces and when you
        get used to the idiosyncracies, you can even make it somewhat reliable. (...)</para>

You can start YaST from the Computer Menu on your task bar, if you are not authenticated as root you will be prompted for the root password.

      </title>
      <para>For people who are really tweet-o-holics, constant access to <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/twitter">Twitter</ulink> (or <ulink url="http://www.identi.ca">Identi.ca</ulink>, an open source clone of Twitter) is as much
        a necessity as food and water. At varying levels, this may also be true for those who are
        fans of Twitter but not necessarily tweet-o-holics.</para>
      <para>One possible choice is to have Twitter up and running in the browser most of the time.
        While this is a feasible solution, you’ll start missing out when the browser is minimized.
        Also, a browser isn’t exactly lightweight on system resources. Therefore, your best bet
        would be to use a well-built Twitter desktop client.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">About Chokoq</emphasis></para>
      <para><ulink url="http://choqok.gnufolks.org">Choqok</ulink> is a slim Twitter and Identi.ca
        client made to integrate well with the <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/kde">KDE</ulink> desktop environment. As far as social media clients go, <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/gwibber-the-everything-client/">Gwibber</ulink> may be a
        more well known piece of software, but it’s best suited to run under a <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/gnome">GNOME</ulink> desktop. You’re always welcome to
        try Gwibber with KDE, but I’ve always preferred software native to the desktop environment
        you’re using. With Choqok, you can quickly and easily reach your Twitter stream at any time
        and get notifications that appear right on your desktop. (...)</para>

      <para>I’ve been working in this industry for a while now and naturally spend a lot of time using Linux on a daily basis. This gives lots of exposure to various Linux commands and tools. That said, I am sometimes surprised when I see, often very experienced system administrators, using somewhat convoluted commands to do something relatively simple using a different tool.

      </title>
      <para>Nowadays, few enterprise websites run without <ulink url="http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/php">PHP</ulink>, the dynamic scripting language that serves as the “P” in the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</ulink> stack. Coding PHP applications is relatively easy thanks to the abundance of high-quality PHP frameworks available. Here’s a high-level overview of several of these open source frameworks, noting their scalability, maturity, licenses, and commercial support. While they may differ in many ways, they have one thing in common: they cost nothing to try and to use.</para>
      <para>PHP frameworks not only make web development fast and easy but also standardize and streamline the whole development process. They are much more than just snippets of code or libraries you can reuse. They guide you through the whole development process, from laying out file structures to building data connectors and performing unit tests. All of these popular frameworks are object-oriented and follow the Model-View-Controller (<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</ulink>) design philosophy.

      <para>You’re probably familiar with the popular proprietary commercial package Norton Ghost.
        The problem with these kind of software packages is that it takes a lot of time to massively
        clone systems to many computers. You’ve probably also heard of Symantec’s solution to this
        problem, Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition with multicasting. Well, now there is an
        OpenSource clone system (OCS) solution called Clonezilla with unicasting and multicasting!

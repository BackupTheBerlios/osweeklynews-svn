        popularity in such a short amount of time. Though there is not much of a difference between
        LibreOffice Writer and its Oracle-owned predecessor, there are some tricks that can help you
        get the most out of it. Here's a look at 7 such tricks. (...)</para>

        digital music have changed the music industry. ýAt the moment, Amazon’s Kindle seems to be

        to be driving ebook growth, as suggested by <ulink

          >this article</ulink> that describes why Barry Eisler turned down a $500,000 deal from a
        mainstream publisher, choosing instead to self-publish. ýThis particular article was in fact
        my own tipping point: I had written a science fiction novel 30 years ago that I was unable
        to get any of the publishing houses interested in at the time. ýI thought to myself, “Why
        not?” ýSo I dusted off the old digital manuscript, completely rewrote the story, and
        recently published it on Amazon’s Kindle publishing site. ýBTW, for more info on how the
        original digital manuscript migrated from machine to machine over that thirty year period,
        see the Author’s Note on the home page for my novel, <ulink

      <para>HTML and CSS have come a long way from where they started. In the 90&apos;s, before CSS was formally introduced, the focus was purely on the functionality of web pages. They looked ugly, but no one really complained since they were not aware of what promises CSS would bring. The only way to make the page look beautiful was to use loads of images but the lack of high speed internet connections prevented developers from using that approach since it hampered the user&apos;s experience.

</para>
      <para>Over the years, as CSS advanced, it enabled the developer to style certain form elements like text fields and textareas. Other elements like select menus, radio buttons and checkboxes were left unstylable. When I first read the discussions about CSS3 on the internet, I became hopeful that it will allow us to style these form elements too. Unfortunately, my wishes were not granted. So until they do, we are forced to use work-around solutions for it. (...)</para>

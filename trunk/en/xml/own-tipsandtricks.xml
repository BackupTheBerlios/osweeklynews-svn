      </title>
      <para>There are so many clever ways to share photos on the Web that the idea of creating a
        static HTML photo gallery may sound positively obsolete. But in certain situations, the
        ability to turn a bunch of photos into an HTML gallery can come in rather handy. For
        starters, serving a bunch of static HTML pages is less complicated than setting up a
        dedicated photo sharing solution, which can be useful if you want to host a photo gallery on
        your own server. An HTML gallery usually requires less resources, too, so you can host it on
        modest hardware. Also, you can store an HTML gallery on a USB stick and use it as your photo
        portfolio you can display even when offline. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>If you don&apos;t include master pages (which are really styles under another name), then
        Scribus supports three types of hierarchial styles: lines, character, and paragraph. As in
        any other self-respecting word processor or layout application, these styles allow you to
        apply detailed sets of formatting options quickly, without having to change each instance of
        a formatting option individually. However, styles are implemented idiosyncratically in
        Scribus, so they can take time to learn, even if you are familiar with the basic concept
        from other applications.</para>
      <para>One of the conceptual problems you may have is that styles are defined and applied in
        different places in the editing window. To define and manage styles, you open the Style
        Manager, by selecting Edit -&gt; Styles or pressing the F3 key. However, to apply styles,
        you either select Properties from the right-click menu of a selected object or press the F2
        key. For paragraph styles, you also have the option of selecting Edit Text from the
        right-click menu of a selected text frame, or selecting Ctrl+T to open the Story
        Editor.</para>

</para>
      <para>This utility uses ssh-keygen and ssh_copy_id to create RSA private/public key pairs for use by SSH protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The public key is then copied onto a remote system. You can now SSH to the remote system without the use of a password from the specified machine.

</para>
      <para>If the file /etc/root/.ssh/authorized_keys exists on the destination system, you probably already have it setup.

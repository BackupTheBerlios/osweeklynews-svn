      <para>The KDE NetworkManager plasmoid used in openSUSE 11.4 has some issues and rough edges.
        Some of those will be fixed in an online update expected to be out soon. If you want to help
        make the NetworkManager plasmoid better you can read about filing good bug reports against
        it <ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/NetworkManagement">here</ulink>.</para>
      <para>If the plasmoid is not working for your needs you can easily and safely use the GNOME
        NetwokManager applet (nm-applet) in KDE instead. Just follow the steps below (# means run as
        root, $ means run as normal user):<itemizedlist>

        efficient. </para>
      <para>Everyone wants faster Web browsing. After all, who has time to wait for Web pages to
        load these days? This is especially true if you’re a tab-junkie like me. When you live with
        an open browser containing 10 to 15 tabs running at any given time, you know how crucial it
        is to have as fast a browsing experience as possible. But how do you manage this? Are there
        tricks to getting more speed when your pipe is maxed out already? You bet your sweet bits
        and bytes there are. </para>
      <para>Not every solution will work for every user, and not every solution should even be
        attempted by every user. However, if you like to eke out as much blood as you can from every
        turnip, let’s see how you can squeeze a bit more speed from your browsing experience.

      <para>In order to use iTunes University, I had to install iTunes on my notebook that is
        running openSUSE 11.4. It is quite easy to get some old version of iTunes from <ulink
          url="http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php">http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php</ulink> but
        trying to install it on a 64bit machine with wine always failed.</para>
      <para>In the end, I could install a 32bit version by doing the following:</para>
      <programlisting>rm -rf ~/.wine #(don't do this if you have other wine applications installed, it basically kills any previous wine installation)
export WINEARCH=win32
wine ~/Downloads/iTunesSetup1021.exe</programlisting>
      <para>To start iTunes later on, it is sufficient to run the following
        command:<screen>wine c:/Program\ Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe</screen></para>
      <para>Unfortunately, with most of the available courses on iTunes University, I get conversion
        errors. To circumvent this, I just download the respective courses and view them with
        mplayer:<screen>cd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/iTunes U/
mplayer -vo xv &lt;course file></screen></para>
      <para>This is not too nice, but at least it allows me to view iTunes U courses without the
        need for an operating system I do not own.</para>

          Gunreben: Simple udev Manipulations</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>When discovering the /sys file system, one can find quite a number of tunables that look
        interesting and really have effect on system behavior. Especially when experimenting with
        different values of read ahead for block devices or e.g. setting the stripe_cache_size for
        raid5, the performance for my software raid was improved a lot. </para>
      <para>To make that settings permanent, one can try and go for /etc/init.d/boot.local. More
        elegant however is to add some udev rule that does the necessary changes for you. It turns
        out, that this is quite easy. For example, the read ahead for block devices is found in
        /sys/block/*/bdi/read_ahead_kb. To check your current read ahead of /dev/sda, you may
        use:<screen>cat /sys/block/sda/bdi/read_ahead_kb</screen></para>
      <para>However you may also want to change that setting. To accomplish that, just echo the
        desired number into the read
        ahead:<screen>echo 4100 > /sys/block/sda/bdi/read_ahead_kb</screen></para>
      <para>To automatically do the setting when the device appears, just add the following file to
        /etc/udev/rules.d/83-ra.rules:<screen>cat /etc/udev/rules.d/83-ra.rules
# increase readahead for sd* devices
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd*", ATTR{bdi/read_ahead_kb}="4100"</screen></para>
      <para>When adding a udev rule for this, one just needs to know that “==” (two equal signs) is
        a check, and “=” (one equal sign) is a setting. </para>
      <para>Note, that some devices may take the read ahead from the underlying device; noteably
        when using drbd, setting the read ahead on the underlying device will have the desired
        effect.</para>

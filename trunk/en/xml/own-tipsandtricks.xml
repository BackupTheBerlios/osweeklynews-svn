      <para>Now and then, office-type documents need to be converted. The latex users have always been able to produce a variety of formats from the command line, but for the OpenOffice/LibreOffice users, manual labor has been the solution. That changes with unoconv. Now you can convert to most file formats directly from the command line.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Unoconv</emphasis> is handy for many tasks. I commonly use it to convert all documents in a directory to PDFs, or MS Office compatible formats for clients. The beauty of it is that these previously tedious tasks are now one-liners. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>Well, so far we’ve learnt about storing data (either “flat” in file, or as an object which Python does in pickles which are also data in files, but with some structure) but we don’t know anything about storing the code we are typing. This means that we need to go through the tedium of typing stuff in all the time (or cutting and pasting I guess).  It  is especially tedious when we mistype something.

</para>
      <para>In order to do some more complex things in Python we really need to be able to store our code somewhere so that typing mistakes we make don’t mean we have to re-type the whole kit and kaboodle. We could, if we really wanted to, open a file from within our Python prompt and write code to the file (as a flat file):</para>
      <screen> &gt;&gt;&gt; f = open(&apos;textfile.py&apos;,&apos;w&apos;)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; f.write(&quot;print &apos;This is some python code stored in a file&apos;&quot;)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; f.close()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import textfile
 This is some python code stored in a file</screen>
      <para>What has happened here is that we’ve open()ed a file called ‘textfile.py’ (again, we’ve taken the chance that there isn’t already such a file, because open()ing it would delete the existing contents).  We’ve then written the following to the file: print ‘This is some python code stored in a file’ (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>In general, MySQL is quite fast at restoring data, but I observed that while restoring 20gb of backup its taking more than the usual time. This can happen when you don’t have enough memory or if key_buffer_size is not set high enough, then it can take very long time to re-index the data. In CentOS 5.2 server with 6gb of RAM, I noticed key_buffer_size is set to just 800M which is very low. You should set it at least 20-25% of total RAM. After increasing the value to 2gb, MySQL is able to reload data quite fast.

</para>
      <para>Though this does trick for me but there are other helpful suggestions also which you can try/check to speed up your backup/restore process, few are as follows: (...)</para>

      <para>In the first <ulink url="http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/428331-ipv6-crash-course-for-linux">IPv6 for Linux crash course</ulink>, we covered some of the bare basics of IPv6 on Linux. Today we&apos;re going to learn how to use routable IPv6 addresses, some iptables rules to keep our experimentation from leaking out into the world, and about implementing DNS in IPv6.

</para>
      <para>You can perform all these tests on any two Linux PCs on your LAN without getting in the way of your normal IPv4 activities. Just remember to undo everything that you don&apos;t want to be permanent when you&apos;re finished. Save time and hassle by having SSH set up on all your PCs; then you can park yourself comfortably in one place and run most of these tests over SSH sessions and never get up, except at healthy intervals to prevent embolisms and joint seizures.

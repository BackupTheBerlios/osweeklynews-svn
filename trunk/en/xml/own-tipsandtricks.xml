      </title>
      <para>One year ago I finished my Master Thesis and I just realized that I never really blogged about it. I had the chance to build my implementation during the Thesis upon the Akonadi framework, which is the reason why I want to share what I worked about. For all who might be more interested in my Thesis, a publisher was so kind to <ulink url="http://amzn.to/evh4lj">publish</ulink> it.</para>     
      <para>The title of my Thesis was "<emphasis role="bold">Implementation of Proactive Spam Fighting Techniques</emphasis>" and the Thesis covered the implementation of two orthogonal techniques. Both techniques shared the idea to eliminate Spam before it hits the user’s inbox. Current Spam fighting techniques like for example SpamAssassin are reactive. <ulink url="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</ulink> uses a rule based approach and a Bayesian filter. Rule based approaches cannot identify Spam messages reliable and have the danger to incorrectly mark ham messages if like last year <ulink url="https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=6269">the date grossly in the future becomes present</ulink>. Bayesian filtering requires to collect a rather large amount of mail messages before messages can be filtered. This illustrates that reactive Spam fighting is no real solution.</para>
      <para>Both implementations required to interact with the user’s inbox and in one case it was required to automatically send out mail on mail reception. The original idea of my tutors at the <ulink url="http://pi1.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/">Laboratory for Dependable Distributed Systems</ulink> was to develop either a plugin for Mozilla Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook. With my background of KDE development I had to think of one framework which handles this much better: <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Akonadi">Akonadi</ulink>. Thanks to Akonadi I was able to implement the solution in a client and platform independent way. Instead of just supporting Mozilla Thunderbird the solution works on all systems supporting Akonadi and no specific mail client is required. It can even be used by users who just use a web mail client. (...)</para>

</para>
      <para>For starters, digiKam’s main window features the dedicated <emphasis role="bold">Metadata</emphasis> sidebar which lets you view EXIF, Makernote, IPTC, and XMP metadata. You can switch between concise and full views as well as print the metadata, save them as a file, and copy them into the clipboard. (...)&quot;</para>

      <para>In today's post I'm going to show how to embed a text message into an image file. This type of messaging is known as steganography. Steganography is the practice of hiding secrets in such a way that only the intended message recipient would know to look for your hidden message.</para>
      <para>In this basic form of secret messaging we'll be adding text onto the end of a file. I'm going to use the following image of Tux for my example. (...)</para>

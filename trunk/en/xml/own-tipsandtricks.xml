      <para>It’s easy to dismiss digiKam’s slideshow functionality as a feature of no particular use. After all, most photographers prefer to publish their photos using the photo sharing service of their choice. But the slideshow feature can come in handy when showcasing photos on your machine is the only option. Running a simple slideshow in digiKam is as easy as selecting the desired album or pictures and choosing <emphasis role="bold">View</emphasis> → <emphasis role="bold">Slideshow</emphasis> → <emphasis role="bold">All</emphasis> (or <emphasis role="bold">Selection</emphasis>). However, digiKam has something even better: using the <emphasis role="bold">View</emphasis> → <emphasis role="bold">Slideshow</emphasis> → <emphasis role="bold">Advanced Slideshow</emphasis> command, you can create rather impressive slideshows with smooth transitions and soundtracks.

      <para>In our last tutorial we had our first look at classes and their attributes.  The attributes of a class are the data which are stored in the class.   The great thing about classes though is that we can use them to relate data to functions.  Just as the data of a class are called attributes, the functions of a class have a special name as well.  They are called “methods”. We have had a brief meeting with methods <ulink url="http://python4kids.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/time-for-some-introspection/">earlier</ulink>. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>This is going to be just a brief blog post with one important image. You probably all
        already know that there is bunch of people in openSUSE community who are working on <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM">getting ARM supported</ulink> by distribution. And
        you probably already seen many blog posts about how great it is working. Well this is one of
        them. I’m happy owner of ASUS Transformer machine. As a geek I have root on my android
        machine. And since not long time ago, I also had a Debian chroot there to be able to run my
        favorite applications. But not any more. I replaced my Debian chroot with openSUSE one and
        now I can use zypper happily and forget everything about apt-get.</para>
      <para>How did I did that? I started with a simple package in obs, changed BuildRequires to the
        set of packages I wanted to have, run <command>osc build armv7l standard</command> and after
        osc created chroot for me, I just took it away. And fixed few things after switching to it
        on my Transformer. I’m still missing some packages, but hopefully they will be available
        soon </para>

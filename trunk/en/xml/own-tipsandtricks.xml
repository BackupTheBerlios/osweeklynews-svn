      </title>
      <para>akeaway: Vincent Danen acknowledges that some of the complexity of SELinux is
        intimidating, but if you spend some time with it, the payoff is heightened security and
        better control of your system.</para>
      <para>Most people who know Linux have at least heard about SELinux. SELinux, or
        Security-Enhanced Linux, was originally developed primarily by the NSA (U.S. National
        Security Agency), as an implementation of the Flask operating system security architecture.
        Flask implements MAC (Mandatory Access Control), a means of designating what processes have
        access to what resources (be they network ports, files, and so on). A lot of work has been
        done to make SELinux as easy to use as possible, although at first glance it does look
        hideously complex.</para>
      <para>Since 2003, SELinux has been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel, and is fully
        supported in distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, Debian
        (disabled by default), Ubuntu, openSUSE, Hardened Gentoo, and others. On Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux and Fedora, SELinux is enabled at installation.</para>

      <para>Now and then, office-type documents need to be converted. The latex users have always been able to produce a variety of formats from the command line, but for the OpenOffice/LibreOffice users, manual labor has been the solution. That changes with unoconv. Now you can convert to most file formats directly from the command line.

</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Unoconv</emphasis> is handy for many tasks. I commonly use it to convert all documents in a directory to PDFs, or MS Office compatible formats for clients. The beauty of it is that these previously tedious tasks are now one-liners. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>If you don&apos;t include master pages (which are really styles under another name), then
        Scribus supports three types of hierarchial styles: lines, character, and paragraph. As in
        any other self-respecting word processor or layout application, these styles allow you to
        apply detailed sets of formatting options quickly, without having to change each instance of
        a formatting option individually. However, styles are implemented idiosyncratically in
        Scribus, so they can take time to learn, even if you are familiar with the basic concept
        from other applications.</para>
      <para>One of the conceptual problems you may have is that styles are defined and applied in
        different places in the editing window. To define and manage styles, you open the Style
        Manager, by selecting Edit -&gt; Styles or pressing the F3 key. However, to apply styles,
        you either select Properties from the right-click menu of a selected object or press the F2
        key. For paragraph styles, you also have the option of selecting Edit Text from the
        right-click menu of a selected text frame, or selecting Ctrl+T to open the Story
        Editor.</para>

</para>
      <para>This utility uses ssh-keygen and ssh_copy_id to create RSA private/public key pairs for use by SSH protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The public key is then copied onto a remote system. You can now SSH to the remote system without the use of a password from the specified machine.

      <para>If the file /etc/root/.ssh/authorized_keys exists on the destination system, you probably already have it setup.

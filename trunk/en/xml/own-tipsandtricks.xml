          >Techrepublic/Jack Wallen: Five tips for collaborating in LibreOffice</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Takeaway: Collaboration tools are essential for all sorts of business documents and
        writing projects. Jack Wallen collaborates extensively on his technical content and fiction
        writing — and he uses LibreOffice to get the job done.I write. A lot. </para>
      <para>I write both technical articles and novels, so without the means to collaborate with my
        writing tools, my job would become infinitely harder. Not only would my editor lose all her
        hair, it would take an inordinate amount of extra time before a book could be published or
        an article posted.</para>
      <para>Naturally, as a writer covering open source software, I use the LibreOffice office
        suite. Fortunately, LibreOffice includes plenty of tools for those who need to collaborate
        on documents (of nearly any sort). But how can you make best use of those tools? These tips
        will help you collaborate with the best of them. (...)</para>

          Scribus</ulink></title>
      <para>In word processors, users generally settle for an appearance that is good enough. By
        contrast, in a design application like Scribus, you have the tools to adjust the layout
        until it is exactly the way you want.</para>
      <para>That is especially true for text. Scribus not only provides tools for general management
        of the available fonts, but also for micro-managing everything from the size and shape of
        fonts to the spaces between characters and words and how a word is hyphenated at the end of
        a line. (...)</para>

      <para>The VPN is very often critical to working within a company. With working from home being
        such a popular draw to many industries, it is still necessary to be able to access company
        folders and hardware that exists within the LAN. When outside of that LAN, one of the best
        ways to gain that access is with the help of a VPN. Many VPN solutions are costly, and/or
        challenging to set up and manage. Fortunately, for the open source/Linux community, there is
        a solution that is actually quite simple to set up, configure, and manage. <ulink

          >Nelson Marques: openSUSE 11.4 with GNOME2 for the ‘cool kids’… a brief howto!</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>In the past I’ve written a small howto in Portuguese to perform a openSUSE 11.4 GNOME2
        featured installation in Portuguese. Until today I still receive lots of feedback and some
        personal emails from Portuguese and Brazilian (mostly) users about it.</para>
      <para>I’ve always preached that the nice of openSUSE was the fact of allowing the users to
        install a vast number of repositories and running an updated application layer on top of a
        powerful and reliable base. This article isn’t really about ‘installing’ openSUSE, but
        instead it’s focused on the post install configuration of kinky repositories and stuff that
        by the traditional reasons isn’t provided as standard in openSUSE.</para>
      <para>This document will cover the following aspects:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Installation of sub-pixel font rendering (from a OBS user repository);</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Installation of latest development release of Wine (1.3.21);</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Installation of the most common multimedia codecs from Packman Essentials;</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>
      <para>At the end, the user should have a working openSUSE 11.4 GNOME2 Desktop with very cool
        sub-pixel font rendering (this really kicks ass) and have an idea of the potential that
        openSUSE can deploy for customized systems. (...)</para>

      <para>So IPv6 has been around a while now but do we know any benefits? We may know that it is 128bits long and too difficult to type but if that is all then we do ourselves a little injustice in not knowing how easy IPv6 can make our lives. So let us take a look at some of the automation features of IPv6 including auto-address assignment, router discovery and why we do not need a broadcast address. (...)</para>

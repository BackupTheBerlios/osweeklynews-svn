      </title>
      <para>OpeSUSE, like Fedora, doesn&apos;t support non-free/proprietary formats in the community version. So, if you want to use proprietary or restricted codecs you will have to install restricted formats. It&apos;s extremely easy using openSUSE KDE.

Just visit this <ulink url="http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_formats/12.1">page</ulink> and select the easier <ulink url="http://opensuse-community.org/codecs-kde.ymp">1-click</ulink> installation. (...)</para>

      <para>I had to struggled a bit to connect my HP Photosmart Prem c410 printer on openSUSE. Coming from Ubuntu, I was used to &apos;add printer&apos; button and just follow the click-next procedure.</para>
      <para>Under openSUSE it&apos;s a bit different. openSUSE 12.1 comes with HPLIP Tool which makes it easier to install and configure HP printers. If your printer is connected through the wireless (as was mine), you can set it up using this tool.</para>
      <para>HPLIP wants the user to be added to several groups (I learned that after 3 failed attempts, so I am saving your time). Before firing the HP Tool, go to YaST and click on &apos;User and Group Management Accounts&apos;. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>There is a very tiny (extremely tiny, as tiny as a microbe) price you have to pay when you use a highly customizable desktop environment like KDE. I had issues with networking (which was more to do with my ignorance than KDE) under openSUSE KDE 12.1.</para>
      <para>While the live version showed the network icon in the tray, once I installed it on my desktop it was gone. There was no Internet.  I noticed this behavior only on the desktop, everything was fine on my laptop.</para>
      <para>The reason being KDE defaults to YaST&apos;s Network setting if it detects that you are running a desktop. (...)</para>

      <para>This is my first blog post for the assignment “Development Tools” , so i could say that
        i am very happy with this matter!</para>
      <para>Well i use openSUSE Linux 12.1 and i am very proud of that! Sometimes i face problems
        like , lack of packages for programs, but this matter doesn’t mean that you cannot install
        the software you wish. In my case i installed Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo SR1) due to i have to use
        the <ulink url="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Marketplace</ulink>. Eclipse
        Marketplace offers a thousand of plug-ins and extra features available for Eclipse platform.
        It is a truth that i searched a lot in order to find a package or a “one-click install” file
        but the result was an installation of 3.6.2 version. As we all know in FLOSS always there is
        a way to overcome problems and also fix them. Furthermore as a developer i have to use the
          “<ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/indigor">Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</ulink>“. Here are the instructions on how-to install
        (via terminal) this edition of Eclipse. (Some images are in greek language , due to the fact

      <para>If you routinely use multiple computers, it can be a challenge to keep your data files organized and to manage multiple login IDs. <ulink url="http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/openssh">OpenSSH</ulink> can help you with those tasks. It’s a powerful, secure tool that lets you share files without having to set up a file server, run applications remotely, and perform remote administration chores quickly and securely. You probably already know how to <ulink url="http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2011/stop-using-ftp-how-to-transfer-files-securely/">use OpenSSH for file transfers</ulink>. Here we’ll uncover some less well-known OpenSSH tricks that can make life easier for roaming computer users.</para>
      <para>To use the software, you should have the OpenSSH server and client installed and working on all the computers you need to access. In this article I use local for the computer we’re launching an OpenSSH session from, and remote to refer to the computer we’re logging into. (...)</para>

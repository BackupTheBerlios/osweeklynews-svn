        <ulink url="http://dominique.leuenberger.net/blog/?p=178">Dominique Leuenberger: how to fix
          brp and rpmlint warnings – today:I: Program causes undefined operation(likely same
          variable used twice and post/pre incremented in the same expression)</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>It seems the planned series sort of finds an audience, which in turn of course is
        motivational to keep on writing it. Today, we’ll have a look at this Informational message
        in BRP
        checks:<screen>I: Program causes undefined operation
 (likely same variable used twice and post/pre incremented in the same expression).
 e.g. x = x++; Split it in two operations.</screen></para>
      <para>This is currently informational only and is not failing the build, but you might want to
        address them together with upstream. </para>
      <para>I assume you do know what “a++” means in C (otherwise, you should start reading
        C-books), so we just try to reproduce this error in a simple c test
        case:<screen>#include &lt;stdio.h>
 
int main() {
 int i=5;
 i = i++ * ++i;
 printf("The current value of i is %d\n", i);
 return 0;
 }</screen></para>
      <para>When building this using gcc -Wall test.c, we get this compiler warning (which in turn
        is what brp translates to the information we’re discussing
        here)<screen>> gcc -Wall test2.c
 test.c: In function ‘main’:
 test.c:5:5: warning: operation on ‘i’ may be undefined</screen></para>
      <para>So, let’s first see for ourselves what we would expect this to be? Hmm.. already for us,
        this looks not logic (and I surely hope nobody would write this code). Let’s just see what
        starting this executable gives shall we?<screen>The current value of i is 37</screen></para>
      <para>Now, is this surprising? We multiplied, assigned it to i and as a result we get a prime
        number? By closely analyzing the line you will likely understand what the compiler did. But
        was this expected? If this is actually what the programmer intended, the code should just be
        rewritten to be more logical, like:<screen>i = (i+1) ^2 + 1;</screen></para>
      <para>This is understandable for all of us and does not yield the surprise of what is going
        on.</para>
      <para>And that is actually all this warning is about: it requests the programmer to write code
        that can be understood and does not depend on what the compiler interprets. It might even
        very well be that the different optimization levels or the usage of different compilers
        might end up in different results.</para>
      <para>If you want to read some more about this topic, I suggest to have a look at:<itemizedlist>

      </title>
      <para>In order to use iTunes University, I had to install iTunes on my notebook that is
        running openSUSE 11.4. It is quite easy to get some old version of iTunes from <ulink url="http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php">http://www.oldapps.com/itunes.php</ulink> but
        trying to install it on a 64bit machine with wine always failed.</para>
      <para>In the end, I could install a 32bit version by doing the following:</para>
      <programlisting>rm -rf ~/.wine #(don&apos;t do this if you have other wine applications installed, it basically kills any previous wine installation)
export WINEARCH=win32
wine ~/Downloads/iTunesSetup1021.exe</programlisting>
      <para>To start iTunes later on, it is sufficient to run the following
        command:<screen>wine c:/Program\ Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe</screen></para>
      <para>Unfortunately, with most of the available courses on iTunes University, I get conversion
        errors. To circumvent this, I just download the respective courses and view them with
        mplayer:<screen>cd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/iTunes U/
mplayer -vo xv &lt;course file&gt;</screen></para>
      <para>This is not too nice, but at least it allows me to view iTunes U courses without the
        need for an operating system I do not own.</para>

      <title><ulink url="http://dominique.leuenberger.net/blog/?p=151">Dominique Leuenberger: how to
          fix brp and rpmlint warnings – today: Expression compares a char* pointer with a string
          literal</ulink></title>
      <para>After having seen this kind of question several times, I think it could be interesting
        to start creating a small ‘series of rpmlint errors and their typical fixes”.</para>
      <para>Interested in it? So welcome to part #1 (this issue). The “series” is not really fledged
        out, but I will try to write post for various errors / topics, as they come along. Just drop
        me a note with an error you have seen / experienced in OBS while building a package.</para>
      <para>So what does it mean, if OBS tells you this:</para>
      <para> Expression compares a char* pointer with a string literal. Usually a strcmp() was
        intended by the programmer</para>
      <para>Let’s have a look at a very simple C program, to show the
        issue:<screen>#include &lt;stdio.h>
int main() {   
char *mytext;   
mytext = "Help";   
if (mytext == "Help") {     
printf("This should raise a warning");   
}   
return 0; 
}</screen></para>
      <para>Trying to compile this very simple C program, which on first sight many would probably
        say this is correct, will result in
        this:<screen>$ gcc test1.c -Wall 
test1.c: In function ‘main’: 
test1.c:6:14: warning: comparison with string literal results in unspecified behavior </screen></para>
      <para>So, even though we had such an easy program, line 6 seems to be an issue for
        us:<screen>if (mytext == “Help”) {</screen></para>
      <para>The issue, as simple as it may sound, is the comparison of a pointer (char *) with a
        literal (“Help”).</para>
      <para>So how do we fix it? It involves changing the code, thus writing a patch (there are many
        good helps around for this… I won’t dive into patching here).. Of course, after having
        written a patch, be a good downstream, send it upstream! What you want to do here is to
        replace this comparison with strcmp (just as OBS’ error message implied).</para>
      <para>Look at this code
        now:<screen>#include &lt;stdio.h> 
#include &lt;string.h>
int main() {   
char *mytext;   
mytext = "Help";   
if (strcmp(mytext,"Help")==0) {     
printf("No warning here\n");   
}
return 0; 
}</screen></para>
      <para>I changed <emphasis role="italic">“mytext == “Help”</emphasis> to <emphasis
          role="italic">strcmp(mtext,”Help”)==0</emphasis> (<ulink
          url="http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcmp">man 3 strcmp</ulink> will explain you why… 0 means
        the texts are equal, or ’0 difference detected’ can help you remember that). As the code was
        too simple and strcmp was not yet defined (this of course can also happen in packages you
        patch), I had to add an additional <emphasis role="italic">#include
          &lt;string.h&gt;</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>Not too hard, is it?</para>
      <para>So what do you think? Such a series of “how to fix my typical brp / lint warnings”
        useful?</para>

      </title>
      <para>When discovering the /sys file system, one can find quite a number of tunables that look
        interesting and really have effect on system behavior. Especially when experimenting with
        different values of read ahead for block devices or e.g. setting the stripe_cache_size for
        raid5, the performance for my software raid was improved a lot. </para>
      <para>To make that settings permanent, one can try and go for /etc/init.d/boot.local. More
        elegant however is to add some udev rule that does the necessary changes for you. It turns
        out, that this is quite easy. For example, the read ahead for block devices is found in
        /sys/block/*/bdi/read_ahead_kb. To check your current read ahead of /dev/sda, you may
        use:<screen>cat /sys/block/sda/bdi/read_ahead_kb</screen></para>
      <para>However you may also want to change that setting. To accomplish that, just echo the
        desired number into the read
        ahead:<screen>echo 4100 &gt; /sys/block/sda/bdi/read_ahead_kb</screen></para>
      <para>To automatically do the setting when the device appears, just add the following file to
        /etc/udev/rules.d/83-ra.rules:<screen>cat /etc/udev/rules.d/83-ra.rules
# increase readahead for sd* devices
ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, KERNEL==&quot;sd*&quot;, ATTR{bdi/read_ahead_kb}=&quot;4100&quot;</screen></para>
      <para>When adding a udev rule for this, one just needs to know that “==” (two equal signs) is
        a check, and “=” (one equal sign) is a setting. </para>
      <para>Note, that some devices may take the read ahead from the underlying device; noteably
        when using drbd, setting the read ahead on the underlying device will have the desired
        effect.</para>

        >Heads up on new kernel local root exploit</ulink></title>
    <para>Dan Rosenberg published a new local root exploit for the kernel,
      linked e.g. in this LWN article <ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/419141/">http://lwn.net/Articles/419141/</ulink>
      and for our german readers on
      <ulink url="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/OOPS-Root-Rechte-auf-Linux-1149512.html">http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/OOPS-Root-Rechte-auf-Linux-1149512.html</ulink>
    </para>
    <para>  
      The exploit itself uses 3 seperate security issues in chain, all
      found by Nelson Elhage.</para>
      
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><ulink

        >CVE-2010-4258</ulink></emphasis>: This is the core vulnerability, which can basically turn
      any user program triggered Oops into a local privilege escalation. This problem affects all
      SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE products (but needs another problem to trigger it.)</para>
      
      
      <para>In the published exploit this Oops is caused by: <emphasis role="bold"><ulink
          url="http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3850.html"
        >CVE-2010-3850</ulink></emphasis>: Associating a ECONET address with any network interface.
      This is possible in older SUSE products before SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 and openSUSE
      11.2.</para>
      
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><ulink
          url="http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3849.html"
        >CVE-2010-3849</ulink></emphasis>[3]: A kernel Oops caused by a NULL pointer dereference in
      ECONET. This vulnerability does not affect any SUSE Linux or openSUSE product, as we do not
      have the the sub-configuration of ECONET enabled that are necessary to exploit this.</para>
      
      <para>As the ECONET parts of this exploit are not effective on openSUSE and
        SUSE Linux Enterprise, the published exploit will not work as-is.</para>
      
      <para>However, as SUSE kernels are affected by <emphasis role="bold">CVE-2010-4258</emphasis>,
      an exploit could be written that uses a different method to Oops the kernel.</para>
      
      <para>To mitigate this issue until updates are available, you can switch your
        kernel to cause a panic on any Oops by doing as root:</para>
      
    <para><emphasis role="italic">echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops</emphasis></para>
      
      <para>We will be of course also be releasing updated kernel packages containing
        fixes.</para>

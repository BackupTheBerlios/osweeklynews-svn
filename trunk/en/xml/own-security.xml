        >Thomas Biege: SUSE Manager Security Update</ulink></title>
    <para>Last Friday we released a security update for SUSE Manager. It eliminates four
      vulnerabilities which I will describe in detail here:<orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>CSRF (CVE-2009-4139): This is the most dangerous issue fixed by this update. It was
            found during a penetration-test executed by me before we released the SUSE Manager. You
            may wonder why we released the fix after the "gold master" (GM) and why it has a CVE-ID
            from 2009. Red Hat was informed about this issue in 2009 already and after some back and
            forth we decided to release it together with Red Hat and not earlier. But not only the
            release date was coordinated, we also coordinate fixing and testing.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The default SSL ciphersuite configuration that comes with our apache2 package (this
            also affects the SM proxy) was made up to support as much and as old client as possible.
            This results in a config that is insecure because it support "export ciphers", SSLv2,
            short keys, etc. If you install this update before you configured your SM you will have
            a up-to-date and secure config. Use sslscan to verify your setup. If it is still
            insecure go to /etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf and change it to something like:</para>
          <para>
            <programlisting id="comment_text_0">ssl_protocols TLSv1 ssl_ciphers ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:!SSLv2:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:@STRENGTH</programlisting>
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Open Redirect (CVE-2011-1594): A hidden field named "url_bounce" allows HTTP
            redirects and therefore phishing attacks. Found during penetration-test, released after
            GM because it was too minor to hold release.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>XML remote denial of service (CVE-2011-1755): jabber2 server can be dos'ed ("billion
            laughs attack"), not found by us.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

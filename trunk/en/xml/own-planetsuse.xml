    <para>For a long time that I actively search the Portuguese Ambassadors… unfortunately I was unable to find them. I’ve learned once with someone which is very dear to me a single line that ended up by translating one great universal truth: “Stopping is dying”.</para>
    <para>This afternoon, I’ve traveled northeast to the beautiful city of Oliveira de Azemeis, where I’ve met one of the unknown faces of the Portuguese openSUSE Community, João Matias. We’ve had a small chat about several topics… amongst them:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>OBS – openSUSE Build Service – howto, examples and how useful it can be for students
          projects!</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>University Campus – Event creaton… how openSUSE can represent itself on 3rd parties
          events inside of the campus;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Concerns about the growth of the Portuguese Community;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ambassadors or Campus Activists?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The new ‘Portuguese’ Forum at forums.opensuse.org (Special Thanks to Jim Henderson and
          the Forums Team for their outstanding guidance during the submission process);</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Christmas Dinner @ 11th December and hot-topics.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>We look forward to a smiling future full of work and hopefully with a stronger openSUSE
      presence in the Portuguese University Campus.</para>

        Blogged about: Smeegol Status - 08Dec10</ulink></title>
    <para>Looks like it's been a while since I mentioned anything about our dear friend Smeegol –
      sorry. </para>
    <para>As most will know MeeGo made a couple of releases: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>1.0.5 mostly an update to their original release</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>1.1.0 the new release with new API, and renaming most packages</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>So where is Smeegol? Well we're pretty much there, although not 100%. I have
      1.0.5 all built and packaged including an image. Problem is I seem to have hit a bug with
      network-manager-netbook – it doesn't seem to be displaying networks which is a fairly
      fundamental issue :-( </para>
    <para>I have also got 1.1.0 built, but for factory only atm – I'm having some issues with
      tracker on 11.3. Problem is when I try and run the image, I basically have an unusable system
      thanks to some Gconf fubar but I don't really know what. </para>
    <para>You may have also noticed that I'm still calling it Smeegol ;-) Well the simple reason is
      I have requested clarification from MeeGo, Nokia, Intel and the Linux Foundation and so far
      I've received bubkiss!! I heard loads of talk from the recent MeeGo Conference about how open
      MeeGo was, but it seems that they are only open to partners who can help them make money; not
      open to the wider community. I am not alone in waiting for a response from them, Fedora and
      Debian are also in limbo waiting for information/clarification and general communication from
      them. The difference between us is the fact that in openSUSE if you want something done the
      best way is to Just Do It :-) </para>
    <para>So in a nutshell, before I make an official release of either I need people to test and
      report back to me what does and doesn't work. I haven't tried doing an upgrade from 1.0.3 to
      1.0.5 or 1.1.0 so maybe someone could try that. Jump onto #opensuse-moblin on Freenode or the
      opensuse-goblin mailing list and let's continue to be trail blazers. Yes I know I need to
      align the mailing list and irc channel names, but I'm waiting for a conclusion to the name
      debacle first. </para>
    <para>I would really love to get both releases out as a little christmas present to you the
      community, so who's up for some festive fun? ($ ld: 10.12.10 sm $)</para>

        Award</ulink></title>
    <para>Yearly the LinuxNewMedia give away an Award for some Free and Open software projects. A
      jury give away some prizes for organizations, companies, and individuals who performed
      exceptional feats in the Linux and open source scene in the past year. That prizes are given
      from a jury with well know people from the FLOSS world. Normally there is no choice for the
      readers, but this year is different. The best Linux distribution can be choosen from the
      people. </para>
    <para>Its definitly so that openSUSE made in the last year big steps forward not only the
      distribution himself even the tools that come from the project, like the Buildservice or such
      tools like SUSE Studio makes the distribution of one of them the move the Open Source world
      forward. So when you think also, then get out and vote. <ulink

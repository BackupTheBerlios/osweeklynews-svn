    <para>The forums are a wonderful tool and often provide first hand feedback for things that are
      somehow interesting and many times don’t make their way into the bugzilla. There was a few
      users which complained about Chromium not displaying the icons on the window list in GNOME.
      I’ve taken a quick look into the package and found the following: (...)</para>

    <para>I’m happy to announce that version 0.5.3 of <ulink

        (mdds)</ulink> is available for download from the link below.</para>

        >http://multidimalgorithm.googlecode.com/files/mdds_0.5.3.tar.bz2</ulink></para>
    <para>This is a bug fix release. In fact, the only change since 0.5.2 is in mixed_type_matrix,
      and in particular in its filled storage implementation. I’ve completely re-worked the fill
      storage backend of <emphasis role="bold">mixed_type_matrix</emphasis> in order to boost its
      performance on instantiation, whose effect will be evident when creating and destroying a
      large number of filled matrix objects.</para>
    <para>There is no API-incompatible change in this release.</para>

    </title>
    <para>The latest unstable version of Banshee (2.1.0) introduced quite a few changes and one of the most visible was the replacement of NDesk.DBus by DBus. This change came with a huge pedagogic charge on me…</para>
    <para>Since the changes with this version of Banshee were so deep, I’ve decided to re-write the spec and cleanup as much as I could and ditch as much expressions as possible for old unsupported platforms. This went fine but on the first builds failed heavily by not finding a required assembly file from dbus-sharp-glib.</para>
    <para>My first investigations provided me some really accurate information:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Local tests on the dbus-sharp-glib packages showed evidence that the dependencies required were working properly (rpm -qp –requires/provides).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>OBS showed evidence that both devel and normal package were installed.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A simple “rpm -qa –last” inside of the build root cage showed evidence that though the devel package was installed the normal package wasn’t…</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>And so the nightmare begun… Without having much clues on where to look for and with my helpers/mentors busy with far more important stuff it dragged for some time and started to grind my mind… (...)</para>

    </title>
    <para>I am just debugging (well, not really, I am not expecting anything to actually do much interesting) for the first time cross-compiled LibreOffice code on the iOS Simulator. (So yeah, technically instruction-set-wise this is not cross-compiled, as the Simulator runs i386 code, too, but under a simulated iOS environment.) Not really that exciting, but still, couldn&apos;t help blogging. No, there is still nothing to &quot;beta test&quot;, there is still no actual LibreOffice UI showing up or even any code to draw a single pixel on iOS.</para>

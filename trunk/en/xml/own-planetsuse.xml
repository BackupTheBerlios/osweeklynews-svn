        in Gentoo</ulink></title>
    <para>Some time ago I wrote a blog post about <ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/06/osc-client-in-gentoo/">osc in Gentoo</ulink>. As I
      already stated there, we’ve got some pretty cool technologies in openSUSE and I would like to
      promote them everywhere. And as I’m also partially Gentoo user and I have many Gentoo friends,
      I’m trying to make some of the coolest openSUSE technologies available on Gentoo. One of the
      cool things we’ve got is libYUI. (...)</para>

        brief update on things…</ulink></title>
    <para>I’ve been a bit away from openSUSE in the last months (mainly this summer) and this is
      related to several things that are happening in my personal life. During this time I’ve kept a
      look in several packages I maintain for GNOME, but haven’t been doing anything related to
      openSUSE.</para>
    <para>As many people know, the international pressures in Portugal are placing much demanding
      things on every citizen, mainly on the working force. I still don’t see the shackles around my
      hands, but it’s pretty much obvious they exist and they are around my wrists. It’s time to
      rethink the strategy for the life I wanted to live and move out to living it.</para>
    <para>No changes to be announced except that some weight I shouldered is going to be dropped,
      this is the case of GNOME:Ayatana, which I will discuss with Vincent once he’s around, but
      from my side the proposal is simple, salvage all the packages that are requirements to other
      packages and might have some utility in the distro, all the others, just a plain and simple
      nuke them. It served it’s purposes, but I no longer have the time or will to continue
      maintaining stuff, some that worked, others that never worked. In a way I was wrong, openSUSE
      users are far better with the traditional choices, ex: GNOME, than with other alternative
      choices.</para>

        Kügler: open-slx end-user platform announced</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>A couple of months ago at open-slx, when we (like so many times before and after) talked
      about how we can make the lives of Linux users easier, an idea was sparked. While there’s huge
      amounts of content out there, it struck us that there’s still a large number of people not
      being too well served when searching Google to get answers to your questions. This poses some
      problems though: First of all, most of the information is not in English. This poses an extra
      barrier for some, who might not be as fluent in English as we developers usually are. Then,
      the content is hard to verify: How do I *know* that the information given there makes sense?
      Maybe it will just delete all my erotic movies? ;) So the problem is that there’s little
      content for the German end-user audience, which is hard to verify. So a team consisting of
      openSUSE community members and open-slx employees led by my colleague Rupert Horstkötter has
      set out to fix this problem. They looked into existing solutions to these problem, and found
      that what is currently running as ubuntuusers.de comes closest to the solution we have in
      mind. We got in contact with the team at ubuntuusers.de, and they were enthusiastic about the
      idea and willing to make it happen. A good start. </para>
    <para>Then comes the real work of course. We’ve worked out a concept that allows us to provide a
      modern support tool for our users, which builds on two pillars: information and interaction.
      The concept we come up with puts this into three different tools: a wiki as knowledgebase, a
      forum to discuss articles, questions and to get in contact with other people, and a blog
      aggregation (Planet) which collects news about developments in openSUSE and howtos for
      specific topics. In order to accomplish this gargantuan task, we’ve asked for help in the
      openSUSE community. People were immediately enthusiastic about the idea, and started chipping
      in, helping to review and improve lots of articles. </para>
    <para>Over the past few months, we have reviewed about 2000 articles from the existing
      ubuntuusers.de <ulink url="http://wiki.open-slx.de">knowledgebase</ulink>, prioritizing 500 of
      them, and adapted the articles to modern standards and that they apply to openSUSE. These 500
      articles form the foundation for the knowledgebase we created for the open-slx community
      platform. We’ve also set up a <ulink url="http://community.open-slx.de">webforum</ulink> users
      can use to communicate and ask further questions, and we’ve put up a <ulink
        url="http://planet.open-slx.de">blog aggregator</ulink>. </para>
    <para>So, if you’re a German-speaking user (or future user :)) of openSUSE, hop over to
      community.open-slx.de and see for yourself whether this new platform fits your needs (and if
      it doesn’t, let us know what we can improve). You can find the official announcement <ulink
        url="http://news.open-slx.de/2011/01/17/herzlich-willkommen-bei-community-open-slx-de/"
        >here</ulink>.</para>

        brief update…</ulink></title>
    <para>In the last days I’ve been leaving my full attention to Compiz and the famous glib main
      loop. I’ve made a small perl script to compare my local builds with the ones available on
      launchpad… nothing too fancy, but it seems to work. During the last days Canonical updated a
      lot of software. </para>
    <para>I’ve decided to start updating the on my test repository to the newer versions. A couple
      of new packages are required as dependencies (the most impressive one is utouch-evemu, which
      is a part of Canonical’s Multitouch uTouch stack). </para>
    <para>The number of updates is quite impressive, the number of patches (even on some new
      updates) is equally impressive… I’ve just realized that GTK+-2.0 has been subjected of a
      couple of fun patches and gobject-introspection is becoming mind crushing… Either way, the
      work continues, and unfortunately for me I was planning to do a small open beta phase for
      Factory users soon… but all this changes will require much more work and a lot of packages
      will have dependency lists updated. </para>
    <para>The next days free time will be spent around this massive update, I am sure it will pay
      off. If anyone is using my test repository on my home project, expect some turbulence during
      the next days. Since I’m on this, I’m already starting to enable GTK3 wherever I can do it in
      a safe way, nevertheless, it’s just to speed work for the time being, as much things are
      changing.</para>

        >Vincent Untz: Cross-distribution meeting on application installer</ulink></title>
    <para>Back in October, at the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE
        Conference</ulink>, many people were interested in the whole app store/market place/software
      center topic for openSUSE: we had a session about that, and several hallway discussion. There
      is no big surprise here, since it's a hot topic for various <ulink
        url="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">OS</ulink>
      <ulink
        url="http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-planning-039windows-store039-app-store-for-windows-8"
        >distributors</ulink>, and not just our free distributions. Of course, being lazy people, we
      discussed what we could re-use to minimize our work; the <ulink
        url="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter">software center</ulink> used in Ubuntu and the
        <ulink url="http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2010/09/07/linux-and-application-installing/"
        >app-install</ulink> work that <ulink url="http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie">Richard</ulink>
      did a while ago came to our minds. </para>
    <para>And then we thought: Hrm, why do this in our corner? Everybody is doing this in a corner.
      Let's see if we can work together! </para>
    <para>Obvious idea, right? But on the other hand, everybody is generally all for collaboration,
      but when it comes to do the work, it's easier to hack in a corner. So we didn't exactly know
      what to expect: is this something that can really happen, or is this just a blue-sky dream? I
      decided to give it a try. </para>
    <para>In the past couple of months, I chatted with people from various distributions to organize
      a cross-distribution meeting. I first talked to <ulink url="http://mvogt.wordpress.com/"
        >Michael</ulink> (Ubuntu), and <ulink url="http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie">Richard</ulink>
      (Fedora) who were both enthusiastic about the idea. I met <ulink
        url="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/">Stefano</ulink> (Debian) at an <ulink
        url="http://www.toulibre.org/ubuntuparty">event in Toulouse</ulink>, and we had a great chat
      about many topics; that lead me to ask him if we could help find some Debian people interested
      in this. I discussed with <ulink url="https://blog.misc.ephaone.org/">Michael </ulink>(Mageia)
      to find out the relevant people in Mageia, and a few people were interested in the topic. And
      of course, I knew the right openSUSE people ;-) So after a few weeks, it turned out there was
      great interest from Debian, Fedora, Mageia, openSUSE and Ubuntu, with people willing to attend
      such a meeting. I then sent out a mail to <ulink
        url="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/distributions/2010-December/000408.html"
        >distributions@fd.o</ulink>, to open this up to other distributions. </para>
    <para>Fast-forward a bit, and here we are today: I'm flying to Nuremberg in a few hours to
      attend this <ulink url="http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/Meetings/AppInstaller2011"
        >cross-distro meeting on application installer</ulink>, that will occur in the next three
      days with a group of 14 people. The goals are to see where and how we can work together on the
      end-user experience as well as on the application metadata that we want to provide. It might
      all sound easy, but the fact is that with all distributions building its own packages, on its
      own infrastructure, with different metadata and different users who could create more
      metadata, we're currently not set to share anything, which is a shame. This meeting will help
      us decide where we can mutualize our efforts to provide the best end-user experience possible
      for everyone. </para>
    <para>Three days is a short time for a topic like this, and we obviously won't do everything
      we'd love to. But I'm optimistic about the result :-) </para>
    <para>Thanks to Novell for hosting and sponsoring a few attendees, to Canonical and Red Hat for
      sending people on their own budget, to Debian for helping sponsoring a last-minute attendee,
      and also to some attendees who didn't need sponsorship at all!</para>

        Mac-Vicar Prett: proprietary drivers broken with Factory</ulink></title>
    <para>ld.so.conf seems to have changed to include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf.</para>
    <para>Unfortunately, proprietary drivers like the NVIDIA installed a file without the .conf
      extension. Therefore XOrg did not find the custom openGL library included by the
      driver.</para>
    <para>Tracked as <ulink url="http://bugzilla.novell.com/718734">bug 718734</ulink>.</para>

    </title>
    <para>It has been a long time since I last time blogged about the LibreOffice Visio import
      filter. My silence did not prevent a pretty cool code from falling gradually into our <ulink url="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/contrib/libvisio/">git repository</ulink>. To the point where now we are working on the last 5% of features that normally
      take the 95% of development time. But, let us see what happened since my <ulink url="http://fridrich.blogspot.com/2011/07/libreoffice-visio-import-filter-round.html">July blog</ulink>:</para>
    <para>First of
      all, <ulink url="http://www.derivativezero.com/blog/">Eilidh</ulink> was busy as a bee and, in the second half of the Google Summer of Code,
      implemented support of stylesheets, stencils and basic text. She also debugged and fixed quite
      a number of imperfections that <ulink url="http://bugware.livejournal.com/">Valek</ulink> found. Frankly speaking, this Google Summer of Code was
      by far the best from my point of view. We managed to achieve a very good fidelity of import
      only in about 3 and half months. Impressive. (...)</para>

    </title>
    <para>Scarse is a project for profiling scanners under GPL based on Argyll code. It started in
      the old century and became pretty silent, with <ulink url="http://www.oyranos.org/2005/11/scarse-0-4-alpha-released/">the last news dating from 2005</ulink>. The project provides a nice collection of ICC profiles in the <ulink url="http://www.scarse.org/goodies/profiles/">Scarse Profile Library</ulink>, which is now
      used by some open source graphics packages. ICC profiles referring to standards are used to
      describe the exact colorimetry of a colour space. The ICC profiles are used to convert to and
      from other colour spaces in order to exchange with applications, services and customers. It is
      therefore crucial to meet these standards otherwise results will be incorrect right from the
      beginning and might render further colour work damaged. (...)</para>

        Vintage…</ulink></title>
    <para>Yesterday I’ve seen in facebook a few photos by Chuck Payne from the Marketing team
      showing his collection of SuSE materials… I do have a few ‘vintage’ items as well… Back in 98
      when I tried SuSE Linux 5.3 for the first time, it was somehow expensive to burn DVD’s and I
      was hanging around on a 56K line back then, so pulling them over the internet was not really
      an option. (...)</para>

        openSUSE: Let the user decide if in doubt</ulink></title>
    <para>If it comes to decisions there is always the aim to just do the right thing. In a lot of
      cases there is the one right thing. In quite a few cases there is no right thing but the
      consequences are small enough that it does not really matter which decision one takes. And
      then there are those use-cases where the only right thing to do is to ask the user because any
      other decision would just be guessing and lead to RAM and CPU wasting.</para>
    <para>Yet even in the latter situations some apps are too lazy to ask the user or even claim
      that not asking the user – not even once – is the best solution – and even more astonishing:
      for the user’s good. So basically they claim to be smarter than the user or just do not care
      about the user’s resources or opinion. (...)</para>

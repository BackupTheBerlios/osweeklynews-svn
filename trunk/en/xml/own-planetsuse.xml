        >previous blogpost</ulink> I would like to give a small update on what happened so far about
      a longer supported (open)SUSE release. </para>
    <para>We had a longer discussion on the mailing list if an openSLES (a’la CentOS) or “openSUSE
      LTS” would be the better or easier solution. There are pros and cons for both while the
      required infrastructure differs a lot. I’m not diving into details here though. While I would
      find a SLES clone appealing I’m not in the position to drive such an effort. I also do not
      think that having both makes sense and therefore I decided to go on with the other approach
      for now trying to extend the lifetime of an existing openSUSE release. </para>
    <para>People in the community came up with the project name Evergreen and I think that matches
      what we try to build pretty well. I proposed to give the whole effort a trial with openSUSE
      11.1 which went unsupported with the new year. At the moment we still have organizational and
      technical issues and most likely won’t be able to utilize all the update features (deltarpms,
      zypp patches) but still we will try to deliver updates from a certain update repository.
      Because of the holiday season we couldn’t figure out the details yet but hopefully will get it
      sorted out in time. Stay tuned for further detailed information here and on the mailing lists. </para>
    <para>Please note that this effort is in experimental state still and didn’t attract that many
      contributors yet unfortunately. So at the moment it’s still unclear if we will be able to
      deliver as we would like to. </para>

      out, that some people don’t use it because they’ve got some other pastebin nicelly integrated.
      So to help them out, I created simple script that can help them. It is currently available in
        <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Contrib">openSUSE:Contrib</ulink> repository.
      You can install it, package name is susepaste-screenshot. When you run it, it will let you
      click on any window and then it will paste image of that window. It will also show you the
      link for your paste (in new X window) and copy it to you clipboard. I know that it is not
      prettiest thing you ever seen, but it works. For nicer GUI, ask for openSUSE Paste support
      upstream of your favourite pasting tool ;-) </para>
    <para>btw. If you prefer not to install it manually, you can get it from <ulink

        >OMG!SUSE! team: The incredible improvement of the Linux desktop, with 224
      lines</ulink></title>
    <para>Over the last months significant work has been done on the Linux Kernel to improve
      performance under heavy load in various user cases – including common desktop scenario's. This
      started after the 2.6.35 release of the kernel (openSUSE 11.3 contains 2.6.34) with the
      VM-scalability patches by Nick Piggin. Nick's improvements help desktop interactivity during
      heavy disk usage, for example when you are copying large files or when <ulink
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTorrent">Ktorrent</ulink> is writing a lot of data. These
      patches have had a hard time getting into the kernel, even though Master Tux (Linus Torvalds)
      himself was very happy about the improvements – it was complicated code. But most if not all
      of the improvements will make it into openSUSE 11.4. And it turned out there was some
      low-hanging fruit as well.</para>

    <para>A few weeks back, SUSE kernel hacker Mike Galbraith released the third version of a patch,
      only 224 new lines of code but greatly increasing the performance of the desktop under load.
      Some tests performed by Mike Galbraith showed that this patch can drop the maximum latency,
      the time needed to switch between tasks, by over ten times, and the average latency of the
      desktop by about 60 times. Just when you thought that your 4 year PC was old and you had to
      buy a new one... A patch shows up that could make such old hardware reasonably performance
      again! </para>
    <para>Linus Torvalds himself was again happily surprised that it is possible to change so much
      with so little code., as he mentioned in an email. Testers around the world are echoing his
      statement. The code has been tested on various systems, from cutting edge systems to small
      net-books and it seems to work similar everywhere. </para>
    <para>One of the major problems we all Linux users had was the responsiveness of our desktop
      interface. Regardless of the GUI we used (mo matter if it's GNOME/KDE/XFCE/LXDE or anything
      else) transferring many large files or upgrading our system or making any other disk
      operations, made our environment too slow and this was not good at all, especially for
      professionals where time is actually money. </para>
    <para>This patch automatically creates task groups per user session, limiting the impact of some
      heavy processes running on the background on desktop interactivity. It's amazing how something
      so simple can bring so admirable results! </para>
    <para>Many Linux users that don't use 'high class' technology will be very happy with the way
      things are getting better with this patch, on the other hand users with cutting edge systems
      will get even more addicted to the boost of speed that their Linux desktop will gain. Having
      the ability to get more things done in less time will also affect the FOSS community since it
      will probably bring even more people to Gnu/Linux. It will also affect software engineers and
      everyone else around it. And hopefully more improvements will be done in the future. We will
      propably see this 224 lines of the code on the forthcoming 2.6.37 kernel. Project Tumbleweed
      or the Kernel:Stable buildservice repository are probably your best bets to get this quickly –
      otherwise you can of course wait for the next release of openSUSE in March 2011! </para>

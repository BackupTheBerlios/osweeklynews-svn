    <para>As Allan already mentioned in one of his useful summaries, I’ve been pondering how how to
      improve the layout of the application picker in shell’s overview. While the mockup he showed
      does address the small click target problem, it still felt out of place with relation to the
      dash. I tried to apply different lipstick on it, but there was something inherently wrong with
      the layout and the overview lost its clean, “no boxes” feel.</para>
    <para>The reason for the windows/applications toggle was easy extensibility. We thought of using
      shell to access people/contacts in the same way as we access applications. We thought to
      present documents in a better way without exposing the filesystem here as well. We thought the
      orthogonal arrangement ala Sony’s XMB would be fun on touch devices. Over time, I have come to
      the conclusion that extending the scope of shell might do more harm than good. I’ve never been
      a fan of all-in-one solutions ala iTunes. (...)</para>

        >Kai-Uwe Behrmann: X Color Management 0.3 DRAFT1</ulink></title>
    <para>The net-color spec from the libXcm repository is renamed. During a great conversation with
      Martin Gräßlin from KWin at oSC rwx he pointed out, that the _NET_ prefix is reserved inside
      the Xorg atom name space. So I decided to rename all atoms in the applications known to me,
      which use the net-color spec. The renaming went on fast and all apps work again as expected in
      git.</para>
    <para><ulink url="http://oyranos.org/scm?p=xcolor.git;a=blob;f=docs/X_Color_Management.txt">The
        new spec is called X Color Management</ulink>. It contains the color regions in Xorg
      description and the used device profile for Linux desktop colour servers. Affected are libXcm,
      Xcm, Oyranos, CompICC and CinePaint. </para>

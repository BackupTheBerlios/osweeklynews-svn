        inaccessible.</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>So in my head there’s a little Walter Sobchak beating on my conscience and shouting “This
      is what you get when you trust Facebook with your data, Will”. </para>
    <para>The reason is that I upload photos to Facebook using KDE’s shared uploader and this has
      fallen victim to the whims of FB’s purge of its app biosphere. Unless the original developer
      can convince them that the app is not spammy, offering a bad experience or having the wrong
      attitude, the app, my photos (all archived elsewhere of course), but most importantly, all the
      kind comments from my friends and contacts that represent FB’s only value, get sent to the
      farm. </para>
    <para>This is what you get when you trust one company with stuff you care about. Will.</para>

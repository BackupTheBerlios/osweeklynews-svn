        released</ulink></title>
    <para>I’m happy to announce that version 0.5.2 of <ulink
        url="http://code.google.com/p/multidimalgorithm/">Multi-Dimensional Data Structure
        (mdds)</ulink> is available for download from the link below.</para>

    <para>This is a bug fix release. I would like to thank David Tardon for fixing several important
      bugs as well as implementing some new API’s for flat_segment_tree. In fact, the majority of
      changes between 0.5.1 and 0.5.2 are from David.</para>
    <para>Here is the run-down of the major changes since 0.5.1:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>flat_segment_tree<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>fixed a crash on assignment by properly implementing assignment operator().
                </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>fixed several bugs in shift_right():</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>shifting of all existing nodes was not handled properly. </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>leaf nodes were not properly linked under certain conditions.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>shifting with skip node option was not properly skipping the node at insertion
                  position when the insertion position was at the leftmost node. </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>implemented min_key(), max_key(), default_value(), clear() and swap().</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>fixed a bug in operator==() where two different containers were incorrectly
                  evaluated to be equal. </para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>added quickcheck test code.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
          <para>There is no API-incompatible changes since 0.5.1, so if you are currently using mdds
            0.5.1, your code should compile with 0.5.2 without any modifications.</para>
        </listitem>

        >Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Libre Graphics Meeting 2011 Montreal</ulink></title>
    <para><ulink url="http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/">LGM</ulink> will this year happen in
      Canada. It is one of the great chances to meet so many of the graphics people out there from
      the major graphics projects. As more and more artists use libre graphics software the focus
      shifts from almost a mainly developer event in early years to a mix of artists, users,
      documentation writers, standardisation people and surely more roles. This gives a unique
      atmosphere to the event. (...)</para>

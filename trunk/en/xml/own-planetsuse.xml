        Hrušecký: How do I handle all those MySQLs</ulink></title>
    <para>In openSUSE we’ve got currently MySQL Community Server, MariaDB and MySQL Cluster. From
      all of these we have even multiple versions. Although these packages are different, they are
      quilte similar. So I’m handling them in a little bit special way. When I was adding MariaDB I
      knew that packaging will be quite similar to the MySQL Community Server. So I took some parts
      of .spec file away into separate files so I can sync them easily and left only package
      dependent parts in .spec files. Later on, I created special git repository and few scripts to
      handle patches and patch sharing among these variants. And lately I automatized tre rest of
      the manual syncing I was diong. So today I want to present how do I do MySQL packaging today.
      And that is also some tutorial on how you can modify these packages easily or even create
      packages for other variants like Percona.</para>

    <para>I bought a Windows <ulink url="http://www.rage.com/">game</ulink> last week. What I got
      was a scenic tour through the demise of the Windows platform. I knew that Windows as gaming
      platform was <ulink url="http://blogs.kde.org/node/3104">troublesome</ulink>, but it never was
      as clear that it's actually <ulink
        url="http://kotaku.com/5847761/why-was-the-pc-launch-of-rage-such-a-cluster">moving towards
        irrelevance</ulink>. If you ever have seriously played games on Windows you know this
      cocktail of driver updates, googling error messages, entering illegiible cryptic codes from
      stickers hidden in game boxes, waiting for online activation, going through update popups of
      various origins, and what not. It took me something like two hours before I was even able to
      start the game. I love games, and I have played quite some games on Windows, but I might be
      done with this now.</para>

    <para>
      <emphasis role="italic"><ulink url="http://plasma-active.org">Plasma Active</ulink> brings a
        flexible, elegant, activity-driven user experience to a spectrum of devices. This article is
        part of a <ulink url="http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/10/plasma-active-perspectives/">series
          of articles</ulink> about different perspectives on Plasma Active. This installment looks
        at the user story, and aims at answering the questions “what does Plasma Active bring me as
        a user?”, what are the underlying concepts and how do we plan to achieve these
        goals.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>For the user who wants to enjoy the Internet, multimedia and data away from his laptop or
      desktop, right now choices are rather slim. This means, for example, that you will choose a
      platform with some sort of critical mass, meaning that your favourite 3rd party apps are
      available, enough services supported, etc.. A Free software platform has to bring a lot to the
      table for users: There’s a lot of cool software available, systems such as Plasma Active offer
      a system without lock-in to a single vendor, but rather being able to take apps across vendors
      and devices. Plasma Active already comes with a good amount of interesting widgets, new ones
      are being developed all the time, the development platform is proven to be stable and working
      in real world use, and it’s easy for 3rd parties to develop and bring support for (even “4th”
      party) services. Plasma Active extends the Free software ecosystem into user experiences for
      devices, bringing a critical mass with it. </para>
    <para>I personally use Plasma Active almost every day, I prefer the tablet form factor for
      “light reading”, checking on news, social networks, the blogosphere. For me it’s an ideal “on
      the couch in the living room” device, although I tend to use it in trains for reading and
      watching movies as well. With its powerful email client Kontact Touch it allows me quite
      conveniently read longer email threads. The virtual keyboard works well enough for entering
      short texts. For longer texts, I usually either plug in a keyboard and put the tablet into a
      stand, so it feels more like a ‘stationary laptop’. (...)</para>

    <para>I promised that I’ll write a post about how you can contribute. There are several ways how
      to contribute to MySQL, but most of it means modifying packages. And as everything in openSUSE
      is built using openSUSE Build service, first post will be actually pretty general obs and osc
      howto. In the next posts, I’ll go deeper into specific details of MySQL packaging.

      But I left out the most important part. I haven’t shown how to change anything. This time I
      want to show you, how to create patches, if you need them, easily. Let’s start start with
      package we checked out from obs. Creating patch for anything is different only in first few

    <para> First we got to the directory where do we have the package checked out. We run</para>

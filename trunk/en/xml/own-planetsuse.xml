    </title>
    <para>This week was a good week for coding, and the best part about it: most of my changes are
      now in s-c’s upstream trunk. </para>
    <para>I started out trying to populate s-c database with only a few applications; this meant
      updating the update-software-center tool, and also changing some bits on the database update
      module. I was glad to discover that some functionality I have planned to develop in week 6
      (parsing AppStream app-data xmls) was already there, thus making my job easier :-)

        color scheme for KDE</ulink></title>
    <para>I always thought why GNOME in openSUSE has (and had) green theme(Sonar), while KDE sticks
      with default color scheme, which isn't bad, but...We could also change it to integrate with
      the openSUSE style.I made a quick Sonar color scheme and here is what it looks like:</para>

    </mediaobject>
    <para>You can find my Sonar color scheme here: <ulink url="http://pastebin.com/BiapkPxn">http://pastebin.com/BiapkPxn</ulink> . Save it as
      "Sonar.colors" and import in "System settings". I know that it isn't perfect, but it matches
      original pretty good (you can see Gimp in the screnshot).Hope you like it!</para>

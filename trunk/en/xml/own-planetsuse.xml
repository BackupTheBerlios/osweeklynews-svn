        at openSUSE: RAW image processing with digikam</ulink></title>
    <para>Digikam 2.0 got released recently and while I am really happy about its active development
      there is one thing in digikam which I am still struggling with – RAW image processing. Yet
      since there was progress I would like to share my findings which will hopefully help others
      having the same trouble.</para>
    <para>If your camera supports shooting pictures in RAW format you might want to try that
      feature. However for those that are not into the details of (RAW) image processing the result
      is quite disappointing if you use digikam and its defaults. Pictures are too dark and colours
      dull. If you want to pull beginners into RAW image usage you have to either push them to read
      some documentation in order to get satisfying results or pull the user by providing defaults
      that lead to motivating results and support/feed the user’s curiosity which in return will
      make him search and read further information without any pushing.</para>

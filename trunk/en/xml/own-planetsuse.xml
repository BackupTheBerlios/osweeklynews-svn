        ARMing openSUSE - 111011</ulink></title>
    <para>So HackWeek VII has been and gone, but work has not stopped in getting our beloved Geeko
      some ARMs.</para>
    <para>Now I'll be the first to admit, things have been a wee bit scrappy in places. This isn't
      anyone's fault, it's just that we want to get things rolling ASAP. Thing is, we need more
      haste less speed; we need to be somewhat more concerted with our efforts. So instead of trying
      to get everything to build in one hit (would be great if that was possible), we are going to
      target patterns of packages. (...)</para>

        >Ladislav Slezak: OpenSUSE Hackweek VII - Hacking USB Joysticks in YaST</ulink></title>
    <para>This <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek">hackweek</ulink> I spent playing
      with joysticks in <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST">YaST</ulink> and hwinfo
      (libhd). YaST already has a module for configuring joysticks, but I only supported <ulink
        url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameport">Gameport</ulink> joysticks which are quite
      obsoleted these days. </para>
    <para>AFAIK all recent mainboards do not have gamport connectors (just a pin header) or the
      gameport is completely missing. And if you want to buy a joystick you will find only USB
      models anyway. </para>
    <para>There was a note in the YaST module that it only supports Gameport joysticks but some
      users find it confusing. </para>
    <para>So I decided to change the situation and do something interesting during my Hackweek
      project - to add USB joystick support to YaST. (...)</para>

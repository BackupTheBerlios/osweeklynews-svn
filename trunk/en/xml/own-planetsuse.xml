        Some brief thoughts on Project Harmony</ulink></title>
    <para>Seeing Mark's blog over the weekend promoting corporate ownership aggregation reminded me
      of an overdue response to <ulink url="http://www.harmonyagreements.org/about.html">Project
        Harmony</ulink>. Mark writes compellingly, as normal, I'm just not so convinced about the
      moral excellence of generosity, without sensible safeguards, towards profit chasing
      corporations. But anyhow, Project Harmony:</para>
    <para>Having initially been involved with the project, I'm rather disappointed by its output.
      There are many applications of Harmony that are problematic legally, pragmatically, ethically
      and from a software freedom perspective. I've written about the practise of
        to-corporate <ulink url="http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/copyright-assignment.html"
        >Copyright Assignment</ulink> though that title would better be expanded to certain
      licenses, such as Harmony's, which are tantamount to (C) assignment enabling an unhelpful
      corporate ownership aggregation. Others writing in detail on this are <ulink

    <para>Are you looking to start your own business? You can purchase a computer that most likely
      has Windows on it, but did you know that most of the software pre installed has a time limit
      on it?</para>
    <para>If you see "Starter Edition" it means that most likely after 60 days you have to pay to
      upgrade to the full version of the software by purchasing a key card from either the
      supermarket or pc store.</para>
    <para>Lets add onto this all the new hardware your going to purchase, Printer, Broadband Router,
      Scanner etc, each of these programs installs their own software as well as the required
      drivers which you really don't need!!</para>

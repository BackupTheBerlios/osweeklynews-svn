        Speaks Volumes</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>In May of 2010, fellow openSUSEan Andreas Jaeger (AJ) and I sat down to review how we can
      help promote the openSUSE Build Service, also known as OBS. It became quickly apparent to me
      that while theý service was called “openSUSE Build Service” the name didn’t give enough due
      credit. The build service’s capabilities meant so much more than simply creating a tool for
      the openSUSE distribution. Sporting an impressive list of supported distros and architectures
      that OBS could package for, this was clearly a tool that needed to be marketed beyond just the
      immediate openSUSE Project community. This was truly a tool for the masses.</para>

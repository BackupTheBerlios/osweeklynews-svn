        Harmony 1.0 is out</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>Well, well. Almost nobody noticed as they didn't make much noise about it, but <ulink
        url="http://lwn.net/Articles/450543/">Harmony 1.0 is out</ulink>. I made my opinions quite
        clear <ulink url="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/06/harmony.html">in my blog and column
        about Harmony</ulink> and said we'd have to judge once something came out. Well, let me just
      quote Richard Fontana from Red Hat, who's<ulink
        url="http://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-2">saying what I think</ulink> (but
      more politely):<blockquote>
        <para>(...) I say to Mr. Shuttleworth, with all respect, that I cannot join him in any
          support of the Harmony initiative.</para>
      </blockquote></para>
    <para>I surely don't support it anymore than he does and agree that as far as I can tell,
      Harmony has much more potential to do damage than good in the world of Free Software. But
      let's see how the discussion goes at the <ulink
        url="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/panel-copyright-assignment">Desktop Summit
        Panel on Copyright Assignment</ulink>, who knows, Mark might convince us...</para>
    <para>Edit: read this blog by <ulink
        url="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2011/07/07/harmony-harmful.html">Bradley Kuhn</ulink> if you
      want to know why Harmony is harmful... Long but good.</para>

        gtk3</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>GTK3 will slowly replace the “old” gtk2, and of course, if we don’t want to be left behind
      we have to move to gtk3 eventually.</para>
    <para>Even if slowly (we need horse power! –> yes we need you too!!) LXDE is being ported too.
      Nothing has been released yet, but a good deal of work is actually into git
      repositories.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">X11:lxde:gtk3 project</emphasis></para>
    <para>Thanks to <ulink url="http://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</ulink> (public
      instance of the <ulink url="http://openbuildservice.org/">Open Build Service</ulink>) we are
      currently able to get git code and build it auto-magically (thanks god you created obs
      _services </para>
    <para>Right now, only five packages don’t want to build with gtk3 and they are: <emphasis
        role="bold">gpicview, libfm, lxmusic, lxpanel, pcmanfm</emphasis>. Everything else builds
      fine. As a side note, lxdm gtk greeter build but seems to crasch.</para>
    <para>Please test those packages and report in our mailing list or even better upstream your
      issues.</para>
    <para>To conclude, right now i don’t feel comfortable to push into factory gtk3 packages, so
      12.1 most probably will stuck with the well know stable gtk2 packages.</para>
    <para>Also, i’m actually working to use obs, to provide gtk3 enabled git nightly build not only
      to openSUSE (actually only &gt;= 11.4) but also to<emphasis role="bold"> Fedora
      15</emphasis> (already building with many successful packages) and <emphasis role="bold"
        >Ubuntu/Debian</emphasis>. So if you are .deb packagers, please let me know, i need your
      help. Contact me and the lxde team using our mailing list<emphasis role="bold"

    <para>Following the announcement that <ulink

      support</ulink>, I’ve migrated my mddssource code repository from the old mercurial one to

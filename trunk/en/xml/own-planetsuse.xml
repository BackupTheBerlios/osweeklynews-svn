    <para>Some time ago I wrote a blog post about <ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/06/osc-client-in-gentoo/">osc in Gentoo</ulink>. As I
      already stated there, we’ve got some pretty cool technologies in openSUSE and I would like to
      promote them everywhere. And as I’m also partially Gentoo user and I have many Gentoo friends,
      I’m trying to make some of the coolest openSUSE technologies available on Gentoo. One of the
      cool things we’ve got is libYUI. (...)</para>

        >Holger Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer @ openSUSE conference</ulink></title>
    <para>Should you read this article in a blog roll, here is a clue what it is about: a) the
        <ulink url="http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/">SMB Traffic Analyzer
        project (SMBTA)</ulink>, b) <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/">the openSUSE
        conference</ulink>, and c) <ulink
        url="http://holger123.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/smb-traffic-analyzer-opensuse-conference/www.samba.org"
        >Samba</ulink>.</para>
    <para>You guess it, we finally got a slot for a presentation at the wonderful <ulink
        url="http://conference.opensuse.org/">openSUSE conference</ulink> for <ulink
        url="http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/">SMBTA</ulink>. To me, it is
      remarkable to see a project like SMBTA being presented at OSC because it is not really
      something related to openSUSE. It’s not that SMBTA improves your boot time, or discusses
      details of the <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/">buildservice</ulink>, or makes your
      life with the openSUSE distribution better in any way. SMBTA is very likely not even
      interesting to the casual user, except for some administrators.</para>
    <para>That said, SMBTA was born inside of the openSUSE infrastructure, growing to a project used
      on different distributions and operating systems, such as Solaris. And the one thing we can
      really say is that we exploited all the services that make up openSUSE to the core. We used
      the openSUSE Buildservice from the beginning, and we use appliances created by <ulink
        url="http://susestudio.com/">SUSE Studio</ulink> for both demoing and developing
      SMBTA.</para>
    <para>With the recent release of <ulink
        url="http://www.samba.org/samba/news/releases/3.6.0.html">Samba 3.6.0, among it’s top
        changes like full SMB2 support and other major features</ulink>, it is also prime time for
      SMBTA. The<emphasis role="bold"> Virtual File System layer</emphasis> module that supports our
      current infrastructure is included in this release of the Samba CIFS server and that marks
        <emphasis role="bold">a milestone</emphasis> for our project. SMBTA is already used in
      production at some sites, and the release of Samba 3.6.0 will hopefully forward this
      trend.</para>
    <para>Benjamin Brunner and me will give an introduction talk to SMB Traffic Analyzer at the
      openSUSE conference and most likely <emphasis role="bold">live-demo</emphasis> the software
      chain. We’ll welcome anyone interested to join our presentation at OSC!</para>

        Business</ulink></title>
    <para> Tonight, the new board of directors of KDE e.V. went out for dinner, generously (!)
      treated by our constituency. </para>
    <para>It was a nice and relaxed dinner, gave us some good opportunity to brief Lydia (our newest
      board member) on how we work, boring stuff like where we store our documents, what to expect
      from our bi-weekly conference calls, what granularity of emailing we found to be productive,
      and so on. One official thing we always have to do (according to German foundation
      regulations, so-called “Vereinsrecht”) is appointing roles. Cornelius was volunteered as
      president, Frank as treasurer, both accepted their new and old responsibilities. I promoted
      from regular board member to vice president (which really only has a a theoretical meaning).
      The vote was, as usual a formal thing and we got it done between dumpling 2 and 3 on my plate,
      it took all of 3 minutes. Serious, effective, yet duely diligent. :P </para>
    <para>We also used the opportunity to talk about non-board stuff, about our other projects in
      KDE (we’re also pretty active in the community outside of the board chores), private going
      ons, random fun things. I came back happy about our team, and looking forward to our work in
      the coming year. Just right. </para>
    <para>Earlier this afternoon, we met with the GNOME board. There were also some personal changes
      in the new GNOME board, I especially enjoyed Ryan Lortie (desrt) having joined the board of
      directors of the GNOME foundation. I’ve met Ryan at several occasions in the past, and always
      found that we got a good click, enough differences to keep conversations interesting, but very
      much one the same line of communication. One of the topics was communications across the
      boards, and we thought that having some kind of ‘open communication channel’ for situtations
      which might turn unproductive would be good. Ryan and me volunteered, and we took immediate
      opportunity and went out for an afternoon drink, which I very much enjoyed. </para>
    <para>While going to our dinner appointment, I had really two things in mind, love and hate. Not
      sure why those two words sprang to my mind, but I really <emphasis role="italic"
        >hate</emphasis> saying goodbye to the people I <emphasis role="italic">love</emphasis>.
      Even if it’s very much a temporary thing (our meetings in the Plasma team have become pretty
      frequent, especially with Plasma Active One being on the horizon), having people leave after
      an intensive week of excellent collaboration always makes me kind of sad. That’s of course
      just an indication of how much I enjoy working in this excellent team, or maybe just a sign of
      exhaustion after a week of pushing the Free desktop to the next level with peers who are as
      passionate about this as I am. Tomorrow in the afternoon, I’ll take a train back home to the
      Netherlands, and will commence putting our plans (and continuation, tweaks thereof) to action.
      Exhausted after week of frantic Free software conferencing, but just as energized as if it
      were my first Akademy.</para>
    <para>The coming weekend will be used for catching up on sleep, then next weekend, I’ll be at
        <ulink url="http://froscon.de">Froscon</ulink>, where I’ll be presenting Plasma Active. Be
      there if you want to touch it yourself. :) </para>

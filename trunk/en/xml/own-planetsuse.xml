    <para>It was my first time I mentored a couple of students <xref linkend="fig.mensch"/>during a
      Google sponsored project. It was possible to submit non-coding tasks as well. So I focused on
      promo stuff. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Results </emphasis></para>
    <para>Over all I submitted ten tasks (nine could be closed). </para>
    <para>The first block of tasks (solved by Todor Stoyanov and Paul) was about the creation of a
        <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Material/OpenContent">free/open content
        collection</ulink> that could be shown during demos and presentations or could be integrated
      into live CD/DVDs. </para>
    <para>The second block of task was covering KDE and FLOSS in the area of education (solved by
      TheOne and Giannis Konstantinidis). It started with a <ulink
        url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/SchoolSurvey">survey of needs of students</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/SchoolSurveyResult">doing the survey</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Schools/StudentTasks">analyzing student
        tasks</ulink> and ended with a <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Schools">concept
        for students</ulink> how to promote KDE and FLOSS at their school (incl. <ulink
        url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6538846/KDE_marketing_material.zip">promo material</ulink> e.g.
        <ulink url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6538846/KDE_poster.tar.gz">a poster</ulink>, <ulink
        url="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/work_submission/download_blob?key=AMIfv94cKKVFpAA8e706_2J1ACCc8MoqCqhBAWjiABsEpIzGtTuq9VwmxwFuwODmAadK2XMV1RKEjIGCAH2i87BN6z29AhGH_4i-SRjme1fHwknxKtrN1OZo1TQjvp7XZlYmeZyQZtDJexAQsHkRVScJdEvIjXQ7Ew"
        >presentation</ulink>, <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Schools/TalkingPoints"
        >talking points</ulink> for students etc.). One of the students is going to test it within
      his school. Isn't that rocking? </para>
    <para>I truly believe that KDE and FLOSS (esp. KDE EDU and the openSUSE based Desktop4Education
      and Server4Education projects) have so much to offer for schools and students. We should do
      even more in this area. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Challenges </emphasis></para>
    <para>For me it was very difficult to set the level and the time needed to fulfill the task when
      I was submitting it. It depends so much on the skills and the age of the student. The task to
      find free music and test it with Amarok (support for CD cover, lyrics and Wikipedia
      information) would be easy for a student with installed KDE and with some experiences with
      free and open stuff. A student new to the open source world will need days to work out that
      (for him) difficult task. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Summary</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>All in all it was much more work than I expected, on the other side it was a wonderful
      experience to see how the students developed themselves over time (and how fast the tasks were
      taken). It was a great success and I am looking forward to the next time. </para>
    <para>@my students: Thanks for your contribution. It was a great pleasure to work with you.
      Let's keep in touch. Let's keep on rocking the world!</para>

    <para>openSUSE has developed both great infrastructure technology and a powerful enduser
      product; where is it going now? </para>
    <para>Over 5 years ago Novell decided to turn their new asset, SuSE Linux into a community
      distribution. It was a long and laborious process but since almost 2 years now the development
      processes have been opened up to the community. We now speak of openSUSE, a community which is
      now searching for it's direction. The project has state-of-the-art infrastructure at its
      disposal and develops a modern, stable and powerful linux distribution. Meanwhile,
      communication and marketing are it's weak points - innovative technologies like the openSUSE
      Build Service and SUSE Studio do not get the exposure they deserve. In this talk an overview
      is given of openSUSE's history, the developments in the community and the latest openSUSE
      technology is presented.</para>

        >Florian Reuter: FOSDEM</ulink></title>
    <para>Just came back from FOSDEM. Felt really good to meet the “usual suspects” again. Thanks
      for the great weekend! </para>
    <para>I also had a chance to talk with Jos about ODF Web and ODF Collaboration. Jos gave a great
      talk about his ODF Web Javascript Framework which emerged from his ODFKit efforts. </para>
    <para>Jos had a very important slide in his talk which echoed my own believe: NO CONVERSION!
      This principle guided the design of his ODF Web Framework. NO CONVERSION simply means that Jos
      does not try to heuristically (aka lossy) map ODF to HTML and then map HTML heuristically (aka
      lossy) back to ODF. Instead Jos decided to have a clean 2-tier architecture which cleanly
      separates the content- and the view layer: ODF is content and HTML is the view. I think that’s
      the right approach. Even more: I think if you start adding “smart conversions”/”heuristics”
      and other “intelligent mappings” things will get ugly sooner or later. [And from my experience
      on OpenOffice.org filter hacking things will get messy sooner than you like. Always keep
      Murphy’s law in mind: What can go wrong will go wrong!]. </para>
    <para>We also had a chance to talk about Operational Transformation (OT) in the context of ODF.
      I tried to argue that what is really missing in ODF is a list of “atomic changes” a user can
      make to an ODF document. If we had this list of “atomic changes” we could build a
      transformation on top of it. For OT it is very important that you have “atomic” operations,
      since you need operation transformations for every pair of operation. E.g. if you have |OPS|
      operations you need |OPS x OPS| transformations. So keeping |OPS| small is quite important! </para>
    <para>Assembling the list of atomic operations is a lot of work --- admitted. However it is work
      that every designer of an API needs to do anyway. I really believe that some input from the
      ODF API projects like Oracles’ ODFDOM, IBM’s Simple API for ODF, ANR’s LPOD and Jos’ ODFKit
      could really help. </para>
    <para>Let me finish my post by a classification of change to an ODF document:</para>

          width="30%"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para> I believe that for change tracking we only need “atomic operations” and a way to combine
      them to “compound operations”. I don’t think we need to be able to track changes to the XML
      tree or the XML text. In fact I think it does more harm than good. </para>

        FOSDEM 2011 EOL</ulink></title>
    <para>So <ulink url="http://fosdem.org/2011">FOSDEM 2011</ulink> is over, at last, and it was a
      huge success, as always (mind you, I'm one of the organizers, my opinions might be just a
      little subjective here ;)). </para>
    <para>From the organizational point of view, I was less active this year compared the the 7
      previous ones (yes, it's already the 8th time for me, and I noticed how annoying it is to say
      "8th" in English quite a few times during the weekend): lots of procastrination and my "spare
      time" being vampirized by other activities, most prominently work on the <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board">openSUSE Board</ulink> (which I am now <ulink
        url="http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/01/why-i-am-not-running-for-opensuse-board.html">no
        longer part of</ulink>). Definitely something to fix for next year, and a big mea culpa to
      my mates on the FOSDEM organization team. </para>
    <para>That being said, it was still a lot of work, as it is for every edition, and while I
      suppose that most if not all the visitors are sorry that the event is already over, we're
      pretty happy it is, I'm sure you can understand why :). </para>
    <para>All in all, it was very successful. There were more visitors, as each year, and I believe
      that we've really reached the limits of the infrastructure we're using at the moment. That
      means we'll have a few "interesting" challenges ahead of us for the next edition (no, we won't
      move away from the ULB nor from the Solbosch campus, we'll just have to stretch the space used
      by FOSDEM a bit more to use more and larger rooms). But more about that in a few months' time. </para>
    <para>It was also very smooth for everything else. Having so many volunteers to help us out
      during the weekend, including for the very tedious task of setting things up, was really
      ${deity}-send. Thanks to the support of the ULB networking team, Belnet as well as Cisco made
      FOSDEM provide what must be the best possible wifi infrastructure at an event of such size.
      Our usual <ulink url="http://bit.ly/ewcvgx">collaboration with LPI</ulink> went great as well
      (was awesome to meet my good friend <ulink url="http://twitter.com/fabricemous">Fabrice
        Mous</ulink> again) as it provided the opportunity for ~130 exams to be taken by FOSDEM
      visitors. </para>
    <para>We even managed to fill up our largest room, <ulink
        url="http://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/room/janson">Janson</ulink>, which is one of the
      largest auditoriums in Belgium with 1400 seats, up to the limit and even a bit more for the
      keynotes. That was impressive, to say the least. </para>
    <para>It was a great pleasure to meet so many fine people and friends again (including, but not
      exclusively, Henne Vogelsang, Peter Linnell, Andrew Wafaa, Jürgen Weigert, Will Stephenson,
      Bruno Friedmann, Pavol Rusnak, Michal Hrusecky, Vincent Untz, Michael Meeks, Daniel Seuffert,
      Frank Karlitschek, Delphine Lebedel, Tristan Nitot, William Quiviger, Tom Marble, etc etc
      etc... -- sorry if I forgot you, I'm just too lazy and tired to keep pulling names out of my
      brain at this point, too many to list :)), even if it was usually only for a short chat as I
      have to keep running around all over the venue to get things done. </para>
    <para>That's usually the point where one realizes again that it is so much about the people,
      more than anything else (you are fine to disagree here, dear reader, it is just my very humble
      opinion). So many FOSS projects are driven by so many great people, I'd just love it to last
      for a couple of weeks to have the time to have beers (or coffee) with every single one of
      them, at the very least the ones I already know. I'm really happy and thankful -- to FOSDEM, I
      guess -- to be so lucky to have been in touch with so many interesting people, and obviously
      hope to still be in the future. </para>
    <para>And FOSDEM is also a very inclusive event, where projects and initiatives covering the
      whole spectrum in terms of technologies, domains and (OSI compatible) licenses get together to
      have a great deal of fun. I believe that every single visitor would agree that it is the most
      effective way to get our motivation batteries loaded to spend our spare time, energy, love,
      sweat and blood into doing such great things. </para>
    <para>On the cross-pollination front, which is more and more of a priority for us, I'm happy to
      see the <ulink url="http://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/track/crossdistro_devroom">Crossdistro
        developer room</ulink> clearly evolve into the right direction (thanks to <ulink
        url="http://grep.be/">Wouter Verhelst</ulink> (of Debian fame) to take care of that); where
      not quite there yet, as intentions need to be followed by much more action, but it is a step
      forward already, and such things do take a good deal of time, as much as many of us would like
      to see it happening as soon as possible, especially at openSUSE. FOSDEM is such a great
      opportunity to get together with other projects and people, as so many of them are on the
      spot. </para>
    <para>For a couple of final words, my big "thank you" goes out, in no particular order, to the
      volunteers who helped us during the weekend, to the sponsors that support the event, to the
      visitors who have donated money in order to keep giving us the chance of remaining
      independent, to the people and projects who were there at the stands, devrooms, lightning
      talks, to the speakers who accepted our invitations, obviously to the other members of the
      FOSDEM organization team (we did it again! :D), to the ULB and CI for providing us with their
      infrastructure, and, of course, to the people who attended. </para>
    <para>On a side note, if you were at FOSDEM 2011, please take a minute to fill out our <ulink
        url="http://fosdem.org/2011/census">census </ulink>as well as our <ulink

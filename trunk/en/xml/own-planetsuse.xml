        Harmony 1.0 is out</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>Well, well. Almost nobody noticed as they didn't make much noise about it, but <ulink
        url="http://lwn.net/Articles/450543/">Harmony 1.0 is out</ulink>. I made my opinions quite
        clear <ulink url="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/06/harmony.html">in my blog and column
        about Harmony</ulink> and said we'd have to judge once something came out. Well, let me just
      quote Richard Fontana from Red Hat, who's<ulink
        url="http://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-2">saying what I think</ulink> (but
      more politely):<blockquote>
        <para>(...) I say to Mr. Shuttleworth, with all respect, that I cannot join him in any
          support of the Harmony initiative.</para>
      </blockquote></para>
    <para>I surely don't support it anymore than he does and agree that as far as I can tell,
      Harmony has much more potential to do damage than good in the world of Free Software. But
      let's see how the discussion goes at the <ulink
        url="https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/panel-copyright-assignment">Desktop Summit
        Panel on Copyright Assignment</ulink>, who knows, Mark might convince us...</para>
    <para>Edit: read this blog by <ulink
        url="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2011/07/07/harmony-harmful.html">Bradley Kuhn</ulink> if you
      want to know why Harmony is harmful... Long but good.</para>

        released</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>I’m happy to announce that version 0.5.3 of <ulink
        url="http://code.google.com/p/multidimalgorithm/">Multi-Dimensional Data Structure
        (mdds)</ulink> is available for download from the link below.</para>
    <para><ulink url="http://multidimalgorithm.googlecode.com/files/mdds_0.5.3.tar.bz2"
        >http://multidimalgorithm.googlecode.com/files/mdds_0.5.3.tar.bz2</ulink></para>
    <para>This is a bug fix release. In fact, the only change since 0.5.2 is in mixed_type_matrix,
      and in particular in its filled storage implementation. I’ve completely re-worked the fill
      storage backend of <emphasis role="bold">mixed_type_matrix</emphasis> in order to boost its
      performance on instantiation, whose effect will be evident when creating and destroying a
      large number of filled matrix objects.</para>
    <para>There is no API-incompatible change in this release.</para>

    <para>Following the announcement that <ulink
      url="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/07/google-git">Google Code finally gets git
      support</ulink>, I’ve migrated my mddssource code repository from the old mercurial one to
      a new git one. For anyone who has the old mercurial repository of <ulink
        url="http://code.google.com/p/multidimalgorithm/">mdds</ulink> checked out, please switch
      to the new git repo. Refer to <ulink
        url="http://code.google.com/p/multidimalgorithm/source/checkout">this page</ulink> on how
      to check out the new git-based mdds repository.</para>
    <para>As for doing the actual migration, <ulink
      url="http://hivelogic.com/articles/converting-from-mercurial-to-git/">this blog
      post</ulink> was very helpful.</para>

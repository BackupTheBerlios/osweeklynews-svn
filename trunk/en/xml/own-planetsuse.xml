        more contributors</ulink></title>
    <para>In my talk (or rather: structured discussion) "<ulink
        url="http://www.mshopf.de/pub/XDC_11_contributors.pdf">Methods of Attraction: How to bring
        in new contributors</ulink>" on this year's <ulink
        url="http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2011/Program">X.org Developer's Conference</ulink> I
      brought up reasons why open source projects often fail to attract new contributors, and some
      changes to help this.</para>
    <para>During the discussion it turns out that for X.org the changes are either <emphasis
        role="italic">very</emphasis> non-trivial, or (better) somewhat implemented already (like
      the list of low hanging fruits, which basically boils down to our <ulink
        url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ToDo">ToDo list</ulink> and the <ulink
        url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Development/Janitor">Janitor subproject</ulink>).</para>
    <para>I didn't really expect any direct outcome from this discussion (as it's more like a meta
      discussion because we need to understand the real issues first), but I think it was fruitful
      especially in keeping everybody aware of the situation. (...)</para>

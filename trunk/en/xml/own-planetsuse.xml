        Pancake Sprint</ulink></title>
    <para>Flat things are good. I'm at Tokamak 5 in Nijmegen, the KDE sprint where we plough a deep
      furrow into the future of the Free Desktop and sow KDE seeds that will grow into exciting,
      novel interfaces and make the stuff we already have even faster and more reliable. </para>
    <para>So what about the flat things I mentioned? We've just guzzled our way through a stack of
      pancakes of geological proportions, produced for us by pancake-flipper and KDE allrounder
        <emphasis role="italic">par excellence</emphasis><ulink url="http://euroquis.nl/bobulate/"
        >Adriaan de Groot</ulink>. Other good flat things are tablets (I won't call them 'tablet
      computers' in case I sound old fashioned), which are in evidence here in a variety of makes
      and models. We're working on several things that will make KDE on tablets as easy and fun to
      consume as Adriaan's pancakes. </para>
    <para>I'm here for a few days to make KConfigXT, KDE's proven automatic configuration
      persistence layer, work with user interfaces programmed in Qt Quick, and to support the <ulink

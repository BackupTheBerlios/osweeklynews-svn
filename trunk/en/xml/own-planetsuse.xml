        catching up</ulink></title>
    <para>Hi! It feels like ages since I blogged, so here goes. A lot has happened since my last
      blog - Latinoware is over (and was frickin' awesome), I had a week off which I enjoyed in
      Brazil and now I'm at the Nuremberg offices due to Michl who just left. We had some catching
      up to do before he went - same with AJ who has decided to enjoy some parental leave. And
      Jaqueline who will have to fill the shoes of these two fine gentlemen. Meanwhile I am trying
      to catch up to mail and news - there is a lot of both. Mail catching up has been limited quite
      a bit by the KDE Factory OBS repository for 11.3 upgrading to KDE's 4.6 release of platform
      (Akonadi!), apps (KMail2) and desktop workspace. The two I mentioned (Akonadi &amp; kmail2)
      have been a royal pain in the ass, to be honest. The migration of my old accounts took a night
      (>100.000 mails) but didn't actually import those mails. Hence they had to be downloaded from
      gmail. With the VERY frequent disconnections and regular hanging of the Akonadi resource this
      has taken a while to say the least - lots of babysitting (restarting Akonadi etc) required. I
      hope the KDE Pim* dudes and dudettes can get this stable (and faster!) before the release...
      Oh, and Virtuoso-t keeps hogging 100% CPU untill I decide to just kill it - after which I
      don't notice any bad or strange behavior. Maybe I should auto-kill it on login ;-) but in the
      end, it's all working reasonably well now, albeit a bit slower than KMail1.x. Yay yay.

        >Wolfgang Rosenauer: community powered long term support for openSUSE?</ulink></title>
    <para>Just recently I found again that openSUSE is not really positioned for some usecases. In
      my personal case that is especially the usage as a web/mail/dns/etc server on hosted
      environments. IMHO it just doesn’t make sense to roll out a distribution which is supported
      for only 18 months to a hosted system with limited access to it. I still have been doing that
      with previous openSUSE releases but it’s so annoying that I really regret it. Also the
      possibility to zypper dup doesn’t really fix that issue for different reasons. Anyway this
      post is not about whining about that fact or to explain why I don’t like to update these type
      of systems remotely every &lt;= 18 months. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">A possible solution?</emphasis> Sometime last year there was a
      discussion about options for something like an “openSLE” or “openSUSE LTS” distribution. There
      is an external page where some outcome was documented here. The dicussions stopped mainly
      because of health issues of the main initiator. There was done some planning and voting on the
      different options but no real results ever happened (as far as I know). So I’m trying to
      resurrect that topic a bit once again: The amount of work related to such a project is the
      critical part and therefore my proposal is to try to start off with a “lightweight” approach.

            versions of packages for people to use. </para>
          <para>I’d describe it like this: An “in-between” version of openSUSE that offers packages
            that are a little bit more current than the most recent release, but not as buggy as the
            cutting-edge Factory repository. For those of us who like stability, but don’t want to
            miss out on the latest. </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>So what does this have to do with the Attachmate-Novell hookup? It tells me
      that regardless of what happens at the corporate level, there is energy in our community.
      There’s reason to believe that energy can sustain this distribution for a long time. Got any
      thoughts about the future of openSUSE, and other community distributions with a major
      corporate sponsor? Add a comment here.</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/12/01/hermes-work/">Klaas Freitag: Hermes
        Work</ulink></title>
    <para>Not every day is a sunshine day, also not in software development. This is my credo about
      the last few days which I spent debugging <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Hermes"
        >Hermes</ulink> a bit, motivated by a <ulink
        url="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=630725">kind bug</ulink> report saying
      basically that the digest mails suck. Well, I had to kind of agree on that, so I revisited
      that topic. </para>
    <para>Do you remember what Hermes is? We use Hermes in the openSUSE infrastructure to handle
      notifications. Since we do not want to send people emails they do not explicitly agree that
      they want it (otherwise it would be spamming, right?), we invented a system that recognizes
      all kinds of events that happen in the openSUSE world, than check if a certain user wants to
      know about it and finally send it to these users. The benefit the user of the system is that
      he can pick from a huge variety of events and control if and how he gets informed about.
      Hermes does not only serve users with email but also maintains RSS feeds, it Twitters and does
      even more. And as another bonus, it can collect similar events for you and later send a digest
      with a collection. That way, you for example can get a mail with a list of failed package
      builds in OBS each hour instead a mail every fife seconds for each and every failing package. </para>
    <para>But back to my debugging fun: I was mainly fixing the appearance of the digest messages:
      They now in the subject tell you how many events are digested and how frequently the digest
      comes, such as hourly, minutely etc. In the mail body, you now find a numbered “table of
      contents” of the mail and the individual events nicely listed. So much more useful. </para>
    <para>Unfortunately it wasn’t the most time efficient debugging session I ever had, I stumbled
      over some things that weren’t optimal now in an environment where Hermes processes between
      40,000 and 70,000 events a day for more than 25,000 users. Some of the problems are ugly to
      identify. I got lost a bit which is not good for the overall mood, so I decided to cry at
      Susanne, one of our colleagues. She asked me quite a few questions and than she left home for
      dinner. Ten minutes later I could nail the bug. </para>
    <para>So this is my strong suggestion: If in debugging trouble, talk to your friends. Tell about
      the problem, share your misfortune. A few question can guide you to the right path which you
      did not see before. Not new? Well, yes, of course we knew that already from other topics in
      live, talking helps ;-) </para>
    <para>The other suggestion I wanted to make: Check Hermes digests! Go to the <ulink
        url="http://hermes.opensuse.org">Hermes Subscription Page</ulink> and change one of your
      subscriptions to digest mode, will be fun. Let me know what you think. </para>

        paste</ulink></title>
    <para>As some of you know, we have our own paste service – susepaste.org. Miska is responsible
      for that service and some time ago we had a little conversation, that for me and the other
      artists is more useful to pasting pictures. But not only for us, some times is a screenshot
      helpful for others too. So Miska take care of my feature wish and implemented pasting of
      pictures. He wrote already a <ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/index.php/blog/show/Pasting-images.html">blogpost</ulink>
      for it. You can use the picture pasting if you select “Image File” at susepast or go directly
      to http://img.susepaste.org. So nothing new until yet, why then a blogpost again. Its simple
      today, I tried to use the service and failed. I simple did a screenshot and tried to paste it,
      and the service told me, its only allowed to past images not bigger then 300k. A simple
      screenshot, depending from the resolution is bigger as that. So I spoke with Miska again, the
      problem for the file size is that he have not so lot of space for the service. But he had
      immediatly a great solution for this and implemented it. You can paste greater pictures now,
      it depends from the time, the pic should be kept. So for me that works excellent, because
      mostly I need it for seconds or better until the opposite told me thats what I want or
      something like that. So now it works really fine for me, thx to Miska.</para>

    <para>Just kidding, on the fifth day of our countdown to openSUSE 11.4 I wanted to highlight an
      impressive new application that is making it's debut with this release: <ulink

      publishing applications, Scribus is:</para>

      with seem pretty excited about it. </para>

    <para>The <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27150124">Gutenprint project is going to tag its colour related print options</ulink> with the <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/OpenIcc#PPDcolouring">ColorKeyWords PPD entry</ulink>. Thus Gutenprint follows a request to tag colour related options in native device API's. Marking colour related options as being colour related will help automatic profile selection depending on the calibration state in the deriver. So if Gutenprint was set to a increased brightness of 1.1 and the media size is A5, then the colour marked brightness setting will play a role in searching the correct ICC profile, while the non colour hinted paper size will not influence the ICC profile search. This concept works as well for SANE and Xorg. The colour related options can be serialised to a common file format, which still has to be defined. Then this calibration information can be embedded by profilers into ICC profiles. Such calibration data enriched ICC profiles can then even be used to setup the calibration state of a given device + driver combination and automatically ensure the correct usage, while minimising user errors. That approach is already deployed in Oyranos' Xorg module. For display profiles it is typical to embed the calibration data inside the ICC profiles for a long time. The embedded calibration data is used to setup the graphics card to work with the display. Gutenprint is the next candidate to get related to ICC colour management a similar calibration support. </para>

    <para>We're down to the final stretch! Only a few more days until openSUSE 11.4 is <emphasis role="bold">finally released</emphasis>! (March 10th)</para>
    <para role="bold">We've talked about <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/ten-days-opensuse-day-two-libreoffice">LibreOffice</ulink> and <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/ten-days-opensuse-day-five-scribus">Scribus</ulink>, but now let's talk about something <emphasis role="italic">fun</emphasis> (not that spreadsheeting isn't fun..). <emphasis role="bold">Music</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>An integral part to any modern desktop experience is great music and openSUSE tries to meet everybody's musical needs by shipping numerous players such as: Banshee, Amarok and Rhythmbox. What I consider the holy trinity of popular open source music apps.</para> 
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Banshee</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you're a lover of <ulink url="http://banshee.fm/">Banshee</ulink> then you may have read about some of the updates already in <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/03/gnome-on-opensuse-11-4/">this post on GNOME in 11.4</ulink> over at <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/">news.opensuse.org</ulink>. The upcoming release of openSUSE (11.4) bundles Banshee 1.9.3 which is another stepping stone release to Banshee <emphasis role="bold">2.0</emphasis> which is due out in mid-Aoril.</para>
    <para>Packed into Banshee 1.9.3 are a number of bug fixes and improvements for developers, but from a user's perspective you can expect to find this Banshee more stable and more integrated with a number of new devices such as the Nexus S and Xperia X10 mini pro.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Amarok</emphasis></para>
    <para>The openSUSE team decided to bundle <ulink url="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</ulink> 2.4.0 for KDE users, and everybody else I suppose. This point-release from the Amarok crew, nicknamed "Slipstream", includes plenty of bug fixes, performances improvements, new features and support for new devices. The biggest feature addition that I've found in this release is <emphasis role="bold">transcoding</emphasis>! With Amarok in the new openSUSE 11.4, you can convert files from one format to another right there in Amarok!</para>
    <para>"Slipstream" also includes faster music collection support and has brought with it some great improvements to tagging. It literally takes two clicks to tag music in the new Amarok.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Rythmbox</emphasis></para>
    <para>openSUSE 11.4 also bundles the popular GNOME media player <ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/">Rhythmbox</ulink>. Although I've written the name "Rhythmbox" out more times than I can count over the psat week, I'm stlil double-checking whether or not I've spelled it correctly. Anyways, Rhythmbox 0.13.3 will be available for 11.4 users and this release of <emphasis role="role">Rhythmbox</emphasis> is likely going to be the last "big" release of the music manager before GNOME 3.</para>
    <para>Unfortunately the Rhythmbox folks don't make <ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/rhythmbox-0.13.3.changes">their changelogs</ulink> easily parseable, so the best I can mention is that this release includes plenty of bugfixes and ... other stuff. (<emphasis role="bold">update</emphasis>: Bertrand pointed out <ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/rhythmbox-0.13.3.news">this link</ulink> for Rhythmbox changes)</para>
    <para>For months Banshee users on openSUSE and many other distributions have been sending 100% of the Amazon referral revenue to the GNOME Foundation whenever they purchased a song or album.</para>

    <para>You may or may have not been following some of the <ulink url="http://gburt.blogspot.com/2011/02/banshee-supporting-gnome-on-ubuntu.html">controversy surrounding Banshee on Ubuntu</ulink>, if you haven't I'll try to bring you up to speed as impartially as possible.</para>
    <para>The next <emphasis role="bold">major</emphasis> release of Ubuntu, <ulink url="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/natty/">Naggy Narwhal</ulink>, is bundling the popular music player <ulink url="http://www.banshee.fm/">Banshee</ulink>. Most openSUSE users are already familiar with the glory that is Banshee, so this is a good thing right? Not <emphasis role="italic">entirely</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>Remember <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/banshee-brings-amazon-store-linux">way back when</ulink>, when we talked about Banshee allowing you to purchase Amazon MP3s from within the app? One of the features that the Banshee team added was a Banshee-specific "referral code" that generates an additional source of revenue for the <ulink url="http://foundation.gnome.org/about/">GNOME Foundation</ulink>.</para>

    <para>For months Banshee users on openSUSE and many other distributions have been sending 100% of the Amazon referral revenue to the GNOME Foundation whenever they purchased a song or album.</para>
    <para>Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, wants a cut of this revenue. Well, "cut" may not be the right word, perhaps "all" is more appropriate. Last I checked the "agreement" that Canonical made with the Banshee team was that Canonical was going to take 75% of referral revenue, and then pass 25% on to the GNOME Foundation.</para>
    <para>That seems fair right? After all Canonical is a business that has built itself almost entirely on GNOME and the open source community right? They've gotta make money somehow! The plot has one more <emphasis role="bold">twist</emphasis> to offer!</para>
    <para>You might recall me mentioning how awesome Banshee is (it really is a great app), well Banshee development has been largely funded by <emphasis role="bold">drumroll please</emphasis> <ulink url="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</ulink>, who also happens to sponsor a lot of GNOME, Mono, KDE and openSUSE development. In fact, until  <ulink url="http://twitter.com/abock">Aaron's</ulink> recent departure from Novell, two of Banshee's core contributors <emphasis role="bold">both</emphasis> worked on Banshee for Novell (the other being Gabriel).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Recap</emphasis></para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Novell funds development of a great open source music app</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Said great music app generates some Amazon referral revenue which is sent straight to the GNOME Foundation</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Ubuntu bundles great music app with upcoming release, but decides to take the majority of the revenue generated that would otherwise go to the GNOME Foundation</para></listitem>

    <para>In my opinion, Ubuntu is perfectly within their rights dictated by Banshee's license but that doesn't make their decision to do what they're doing any less "dickish." Canonical better tread very carefully with actions like this, for a number of open source contributors the "spirit" of open source is just as, if not more important than the open source licenses themselves.</para>
    <para>What do you think? Much ado about nothing, or should we all grab pitchforks?</para>

    <para>The 11.4 release of openSUSE, dropping this Thursday (March 10th), is bringing more GNOME to the table than ever before. It might be a bit difficult for me to summarize, since there's simply so much stuff in this one major jump forward for GNOME on openSUSE (some of the <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/03/gnome-on-opensuse-11-4/">nitty gritty bits covered here already</ulink>).</para>
    <para>Do you remember when you last installed another Linux distribution? Maybe it was Fedora, maybe it was Ubuntu, maybe it was Mint. With all three distributions you were probably left unsatisfied with just one GNOME inside the box. Well hot dog! Guess what! The new openSUSE packs not one, but <emphasis role="bold">two</emphasis> GNOMEs inside of it. ;) </para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">GNOME 2</emphasis></para>
    <para>For the less experimental, and typically more productive days, 11.4 will contain the last major release of the GNOME 2.x series, 2.32. This is the standard GNOME desktop we've all come to know and love, with a few more refinements both visually and technically (i.e. bug fixes).</para>
    <para>GNOME isn't just a window or desktop manager, it's a "desktop experience" which means whenever there's a "GNOME update," there are a lot of updated applications that come along with it such as:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/evince/">Evince</ulink>, the PDF viewer became far more accessible by integrating to with Orca the GNOME screen reader.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/Empathy">Empathy</ulink>, the universal IM client, added "meta-contact" support so you can keep all your friends and their cutesy nicknames grouped into a single contact encompassing their screen names from multiple networks. Empathy also seems to have gotten more secure and add the ability to log chats in this release (putting those in the same sentence <emphasis role="italic">feels</emphasis> contradictory).</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">GNOME 3</emphasis></para>
    <para>If you're feeling like peering into the GNOME crystal ball, openSUSE 11.4 ships with a GNOME 3 preview, which includes a beta version of the ever-so-slightly controversial "GNOME Shell." The Shell is a core part of the upcoming GNOME 3 desktop experience, and contains a lot of new and interesting ideas around the desktop experience. While it still has some lingering quirks that need to ge hammered out, the GNOME team has been moving so fast as of late, that the version of GNOME Shell that's bundled with openSUSE 11.4 is already out of date!</para>
    <para>If you're really anxious to try out GNOME 3 and GNOME Shell, there's a <ulink url="http://blog.crozat.net/2011/01/gnome-3-live-cd-usb-test-image.html">live USB flash drive image</ulink> around here somewhere, that you can boot your machine, or a virtual machine from and "try before you buy."</para>
    <para>Suffice to say, 11.4 includes a fantastic number of improvements, particularly for GNOME users. With only a few days left until release, yours truly is getting a bit impatient waiting for all these goodies!</para>

    <para>As a long-time GNOME user, this post and some of the contents within it are difficutl for me to write. The openSUSE team has traditionally done a great job of packaging up GNOME and KDE, and even smaller more lightweight desktop environments like XFCE and LXDE.</para>

    <para>With 11.4, openSUSE really knocks it out of the park with KDE 4.6 which I must say, is bloody fantastic! So fantastic that I've actually started to use the KDE Plasma Netbook workspace, which has gotten <emphasis role="bold">even better</emphasis> in KDE 4.6 . Not only that, my wife now has made the plunge from Mac OS X to an openSUSE-powered laptop with the KDe plasma netbook workspace. It's just <emphasis role="italic">that</emphasis> good!</para>
    <para>Bundled with this big update of KDE are a couple of applications that got updates like <ulink url="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</ulink> which <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/ten-days-opensuse-day-six-rock-out">we covered previously</ulink> and KOffice 2.3.1.</para>

    <para>THe new release of KOffice, a great alternative to <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/ten-days-opensuse-day-two-libreoffice">LibreOffice</ulink> has received a great amount of performance and stability love from its developers. As it's become more rock-solid, it's support for reading the OpenDocument format along with some icky Microsoft formats has improved.</para>
    <para>To be honest, I've had a hard time summarizing what's special about KDE in openSUSE 11.4 versus KDE in 11.3, any way you cut it I'm out of my comfort zone (there is a write-up on <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/02/opensuse-11-4-and-kde-2/">news.opensuse.org</ulink> though). I will say this though: KDE 4.6 in the <emphasis role="italic">new</emphasis> openSUSE is visually <emphasis role="bold">stunning</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">fast</emphasis>. THe KDE team has done a phenomenal job speeding up KDE and bucking the trend of software getting slower over time.</para>
    <para>If you've never tried KDE before then openSUSE 11.4, which comes out Thursday March 10th, might just be the perfect time to give it a test drive and see what you think.</para>

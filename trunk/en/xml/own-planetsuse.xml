    <title><ulink url="http://emmes.livejournal.com/10062.html">Matthias Hopf: Network Image
        Installer</ulink></title>
    <para>During our work in our preload department at SuSE we have to install our current image on
      several machines for each image version for smoke testing, which meant burning several DVDs
      per iteration (and there is typically one iteration per week!).In order to ease this work flow
      I created a <ulink url="http://kiwi.berlios.de/">kiwi</ulink> image for a CD or an USB stick
      for installing the latest image via network - the <ulink
        url="http://www.mshopf.de/proj/netimginst.html">Network Image Installer</ulink>. It's also
      capable of installing arbitrary openSUSE / Fedora / Ubuntu versions, so you never have to burn
      another DVD if you have a reasonably fast internet connection. Network detection is automatic,
      wireless requires the SSID etc. changed in a config file beforehand.</para>
    <para>Find the sources on <ulink url="http://gitorious.org/netimginst">gitorious</ulink>, I will
      eventually try to understand the functionality in the openSUSE build service to create images
      automatically, but for now you'll have to build the image yourself. I'll post when there is a
      downloadable image available.</para>
    <para>Now I'm off to <ulink url="http://www.fantasyfilmfest.com/">Fantasy Film Fest</ulink>
      again.</para>

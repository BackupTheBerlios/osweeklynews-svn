    <title><ulink url="http://emmes.livejournal.com/10062.html">Matthias Hopf: Network Image
        Installer</ulink></title>
    <para>During our work in our preload department at SuSE we have to install our current image on
      several machines for each image version for smoke testing, which meant burning several DVDs
      per iteration (and there is typically one iteration per week!).In order to ease this work flow
      I created a <ulink url="http://kiwi.berlios.de/">kiwi</ulink> image for a CD or an USB stick
      for installing the latest image via network - the <ulink
        url="http://www.mshopf.de/proj/netimginst.html">Network Image Installer</ulink>. It's also
      capable of installing arbitrary openSUSE / Fedora / Ubuntu versions, so you never have to burn
      another DVD if you have a reasonably fast internet connection. Network detection is automatic,
      wireless requires the SSID etc. changed in a config file beforehand.</para>
    <para>Find the sources on <ulink url="http://gitorious.org/netimginst">gitorious</ulink>, I will
      eventually try to understand the functionality in the openSUSE build service to create images
      automatically, but for now you'll have to build the image yourself. I'll post when there is a
      downloadable image available.</para>
    <para>Now I'm off to <ulink url="http://www.fantasyfilmfest.com/">Fantasy Film Fest</ulink>
      again.</para>

        >Ralf Lang: Horde Project pushes libraries to the frontpage</ulink></title>
    <para>As you might know, the horde project does not only release a set of production quality
      software (and an interesting bunch more which are not yet release quality) but also provides
      over 80 well-designed loosely coupled libraries which help you build websites, business
      applications or even commandline tools. To stress that point, the Horde Project now put <ulink
        url="http://www.horde.org/components">a link to the list of components</ulink> right on
      their frontpage. Use Horde_Rdo, a lightweight ORM layer or use the RFC-compliant Imap_Client
      library which performs equally or even better compared to PHPâ€™s interpreter extension written
      in c. Horde_Auth, a versatile and pluggable authentication layer, has recently been <ulink
        url="http://janschneider.de/news/5/342">featured in a series of blog posts by lead developer
        Jan Schneider</ulink>. Like in Symfony or Zend Framework, Components are released along with
      a <ulink url="http://update.linux-magazin.de/Heft-Abo/Ausgaben/2011/08/PHP-Unit">PHPUnit based
        test suit</ulink>e adapted in the Horde_Test class and can be obtained individually through
      the <ulink url="http://pear.horde.org">Horde Pear Channel</ulink>.</para>

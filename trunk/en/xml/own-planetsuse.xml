      <ulink url="http://www.bryen.com/obs-renamespeaks_volumes/">Sascha Peilicke: The times they
        are a changin’</ulink>
    </title>
    <para>Everything changes, so do our packages. But change needs to be explained in order to
      become relevant. Regarding packaging, this involves the art of writing good changelog entries.
      Here is an example from an otherwise very capable packager:</para>
      <para>Spec files updates:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Changes in License.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Updates in Group:, Summary: and %description entries.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Updates in %build section for lib64 compilation.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Minor other updates.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    <para>More often, a reviewer stumbles upon those classics:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Fixed build</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Fixed dependencies</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Changed license to $FOO</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>These lines surely took some time to write but they explain only what was changed, not
      why. The ‘what’ is easily visible from the diff of the old and new package version (kindly
      provided by the Open Build Service), but it’s the ‘why’ that matters. Your benevolent Factory
      review team kindly overlooks such insignificant matters most of the time, but you may leave
      your users baffled. Changelogs usually serve a purpose, for the package reviewer it’s ‘Why
      should I take the time to look at this at all and why does it belong into Factory?’. For the
      user it’s simply, ‘Dang, yet another update, why’s that for?’. You better provide some good
      answers for those questions or your carefully crafted fix may remain misjudged. As a reference
      you may use guides that others have written. They’re mostly about VCS commit messages, but
      it’s the same thing:</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/05/im-going-to-randa/">Sebastian Kügler: I’m
        going to Randa</ulink></title>
    <para>Tonight I’ll board a sleeper train which will get me to Randa, Switzerland by tomorrow
      morning. I’m travelling to that small village in the Swiss Alps to participate in the <ulink
        url="http://community.kde.org/KDE_Core/Platform_11">Platform11 sprint</ulink>. </para>
    <para>What is this platform11 sprint about? (Randa’s trainstation only has 2 platforms, one
      towards Zermatt, one towards Visp. That’s probably not it.) The wiki page about the sprint
      makes it more clear, however:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para> To examine the current state and near future of the KDE Platform (kdelibs and
        kdebase-runtime), particularly as it relates to the growing usage of it in new contexts such
        as mobile or on Windows and MacOS and its traditional usage as a set of conveniences and
        consistency creators for KDE application development.</para>
      <para>The sprint will aim to create an actionable, multi-year roadmap for kdelibs and
        kdebase-runtime and will examine issues of modularity, topicality and the inherent dichotomy
        between the KDE Platform as an application development framework (similar to Qt) and as a
        stand-alone platform to target (similar to, e.g. Windows, MacOS, etc.) </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para> To me, this sprint marks an interesting point in the lifecycle of KDE 4, as we are now
      rethinking the structure of our platform. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Platform or Frameworks?</emphasis></para>
    <para>Last week, we had an interesting discussion wether the development libraries KDE software
      bases upon are called a platform or frameworks. I personally prefer to think of it in terms of
      frameworks, because that has a less exclusive nature to it. A platform sounds very much
      monolithic, while frameworks give a modular impression — and indeed, one of the goals of the
      Platform 11 sprint is modularity of our "platform".</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Plasma Active and Platform11</emphasis></para>
    <para>One of the goals for me for participating in Platform 11 is to make our development
      frameworks more suitable for building non-desktop systems. There have already been efforts
      that work into this direction for quite some time (the platform build-time profiles come to
      mind, or recent work on libplasma2), but we haven’t yet had a focused meeting where we sat
      together to discuss our platform as a whole. That will likely mean a bit of restructuring in
      our libraries, deprecating some overly old stuff, and examining where we’re lacking a
      consistent API for modern needs. Geolocation comes to mind here, and <ulink
        url="http://lwn.net/Articles/436937/">rumours</ulink> are that there’s an exile-kiwi coming
      with plans to Randa.</para>
    <para>Last night, during dinner Kim asked me what I’m looking forward to in Randa other than
      technical and community bits. My answer was “watching the mountains”. As I’m living in the
      Netherlands, mountains are not a normal thing in sight, and the magnitude of those Swiss Alps
      keeps astonishing me. I’m also looking forward to those idle moments staring at the
      mountains.</para>

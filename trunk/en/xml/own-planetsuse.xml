        things</ulink>, there's some less nice stuff to talk about.</para>
    <para>On the other side of the web, I <ulink

      convince me that contributors should sign away their code while running the risk <emphasis

    <para>Are you looking to start your own business? You can purchase a computer that most likely
      has Windows on it, but did you know that most of the software pre installed has a time limit
      on it?</para>
    <para>If you see "Starter Edition" it means that most likely after 60 days you have to pay to
      upgrade to the full version of the software by purchasing a key card from either the
      supermarket or pc store.</para>
    <para>Lets add onto this all the new hardware your going to purchase, Printer, Broadband Router,
      Scanner etc, each of these programs installs their own software as well as the required
      drivers which you really don't need!!</para>

      </title>
      <para>After three years of planning and development, GNOME 3.0 is here. This new version of GNOME delivers an exciting new interface, major improvements under the hood, and enhanced applications. The GNOME release team’s <ulink url="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2011-April/msg00004.html">official announcement</ulink> congratulates and thanks the GNOME community for its hard work on the release:

</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">GNOME 3.0 would not have come to exist without the passion and incessant work of hundreds of people from our community, and without the support of our users. Thanks to the artists, bug triagers, designers, documentors, hackers, packagers, testers, translators and to everybody else who helped us reach this milestone! </emphasis></para>
      <para>You can read about all the changes in GNOME 3.0 in <ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.0/">the release notes</ulink>, and you can find out more about the background and reception to GNOME 3 in the <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/">official press release</ulink>.</para>

      </title>
      <para>First I’d like to thank David Vignoni for his work on the logo for the Randa meeting.
        It’s the basis for the work of the <ulink url="http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/?p=121">young informatic trainees</ulink>. But the results are still secret (as even I haven’t seen
        anything myself but get the first results at the end of this week <inlinemediaobject>

        </inlinemediaobject> .</para>
      <para>And now to the ideas and proposals (btw this has nothing in common with the <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2011/Ideas">GSoC ideas of KDE</ulink>!). As you
        probably or hopefully already know the <ulink url="http://nepomuk.kde.org">KDE Nepomuk team</ulink> will have a meeting in <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Sprints/Randa">Randa</ulink> this June (from the 1st to the 7th of this month) and we still want
        application developers to integrate this technology in their application or to work on some
        interesting and great new ideas. And there will be really good help as <ulink url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/">Sebastian Trýg</ulink> will be in Randa and he is going
        to do one or the other workshop of Nepomuk basics. And here are some ideas and thoughts of
        mine to start your imagination engines:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The KDE semantic clipboard. There is <ulink url="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/base/nepomuk-kde/semclip/">some code</ulink> in the old subversion playground of KDE and in December 2010 I wrote a
              <ulink url="http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/thesis_template.pdf">paper</ulink> about this
            topic. In short, this clipboard enhances to normal one with the capability of knowing
            what (in the context of meaning) it copy-and-pastes. This clipboard does not just copy
            numbers and formatting but addresses, geographic coordinates or blbliographic
            references. Take a look and bring it to a releasable state. There are even some solution
            proposals in the above mentioned paper.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>All of the new <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM">KDE PIM</ulink>
            application use Nepomuk technology through their <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Akonadi">Akonadi</ulink> interactions.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><ulink url="http://www.digikam.org">Digikam</ulink> had (or has?) some capabilities
            to exchange its information and metadata with the Nepomuk storage. What about tagging
            your pictures with the contacts (and <ulink url="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/pimo/">PIMO::Persons</ulink>) of the
            new Kaddressbook and projects which are then usable system wide.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>And <ulink url="http://amarok.kde.org">Amarok</ulink> had (or again has?) some
            functions to share it’s music database with Nepomuk and thus make it system wide and not
            just enclosed in one applicatition.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>But there are as well good examples for existing Nepomuk integration: <ulink url="http://bangarangkde.wordpress.com/">Bangarang</ulink>. A multimedia player which
            remembers what you like, what music and videos you have on your system and where is more
            information about this media data (in the web).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Another idea could be a (scientific) paper or article collector which understands
            the connections (or quotations) between the articles and that the strings at the top
            (authors) are actually persons and the references at the end of the articles are
            actually links and thus relations to other papers and articles. Take a look at the
              <ulink url="http://ontoware.org/swrc/">SWRC ontology</ulink>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Yet another project which extensively uses Nepomuk is the new <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Real-Time_Communication_and_Collaboration">KDE Telepathy framework</ulink>. They don’t just invent yet another represenation of a person and
            its contacts but use PIMO::Person and thus make connections to them system wide
            comprehensible and reusable.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>And let’s not forget the <ulink url="http://plasma.kde.org">Plasma framework</ulink>
            and its <ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities">activities</ulink>. But
            there is more and better information about this on the <ulink url="http://ivan.fomentgroup.org/blog/">site of ivan Cukic</ulink>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Or something completely new. An ontology for TV series, recordings and shows…
            (Update: Sebastian told me that there is already one: <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/oscaf/ticket/44">NMM</ulink>. And Bangarang and
            some other applications use it.)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>And there is <ulink url="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">Zeitgeist</ulink> and <ulink url="http://releases.zeitgeist-project.com/qzeitgeist/">QtZeitgeist</ulink>…

      </title>
      <para>OpenSUSE 11.4 is a modest improvement, hobbled by some installation and font-control
        issues, says this <emphasis role="italic">eWEEK</emphasis> review. Yet OpenSUSE remains
        compelling thanks to related Novell offerings such as SUSE Studio and OpenSUSE Build
        Service, plus a new Tumbleweed rolling release option and Evergreen long-term support
        project.</para>
      <para>Released in early March, <ulink url="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3048642267.html">
          <emphasis role="underline">OpenSUSE 11.4</emphasis>
        </ulink> is a modest new release of
        the community-oriented Linux-based operating systems from Novell and the OpenSUSE community,
        marked by a raft of newly updated open source applications and components. As with previous
        OpenSUSE releases, this distribution can serve in roles ranging from desktop to server.
        However, where OpenSUSE once stood tall among its Linux rivals, I&apos;d sooner recommend <ulink url="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3229986802.html">

        <ulink url="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3929866/">Datamation/Matt Hartley: Problems Linux Enthusiasts Refuse to Address</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>I like to think of myself as a relatively long time Linux enthusiast. In fact, I feel like a fish out of water when asked to work on a Windows box or with a Mac.

</para>
      <para>Like most of you, I can certainly make the adjustment for a day, but I always come away feeling a little stranger from the experience. Guess this happens when you’re bound to a single way of doing things for an extended period of time.

</para>
      <para>Now let&apos;s flip the coin for a moment. Despite the many successes seen from the desktop Linux camp over the years, there are some areas that continue to be left largely unchecked. Rather than automatically painting my findings with a negative brush, instead let&apos;s examine each issue closely.

</para>
      <para>Let’s see if there is in fact a real problem at all. In this article, I’ll tackle specific concerns I’ve noticed and focus on whether these issues present any real concern for us in the long run. (...)</para>

      <para>I have to admit, over the years I haven’t given openSUSE enough love or credit for being
        the outstanding Linux distribution is it. With that said, I wanted to give some attention to
        the latest release coming out of the openSUSE project. And, since the default desktop for
        openSUSE 11.4 is KDE, I will be giving a little extra attention to the KDE desktop. Since
        both might well gain some serious ground, when Ubuntu 11.04 is released, it will be nice for
        users to not only know of its existence, but to also know that openSUSE 11.4 is, in fact, a
        solid distribution worth giving a look. (...)</para>

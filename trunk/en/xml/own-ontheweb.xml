      <para>LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve the suite’s functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.</para>
      <para>Since, at the moment, there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites. Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community, and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.</para>

        the Windows 8 operating system. Leaving aside the many changes in the new OS – it&apos;s a major
        shift from what we&apos;ve previously seen from Microsoft – there&apos;s an extra feature included
        with Windows 8 that has <ulink url="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/uefi_linux_lock_out_row_latest/">some of us concerned</ulink>.</para>
      <para>The new feature in question is called Secure Boot. It&apos;s designed to act as a security
        tool for PC users. However, there&apos;s some concern as to whether this function will be enabled
        without a clear way of disabling it should someone wish to do so.</para>

      <para>Community-based review process ensures quality and reliability</para>
      <para>LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve the suite’s functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.</para>
      <para>Since, at the moment, there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites. Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community, and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.</para>

      <para>A while ago Intel and Samsung announced a new initiative under the Linux Foundation
        umbrella: Tizen. Tizen is a Linux OS for embedded use building on HTML5 and CSS. Cool? Well,
        maybe. If you’ve been involved with MeeGo, the Linux Foundation’s previous embedded Linux
        OS, you’re probably not too happy right now. Yes, MeeGo will have to go. For them, as
        Richard Dale wrote, it’s ‘Tizen or Tizen’t’. The MeeGo community had no say in the merger of
        Moblin and Maemo to MeeGo, nor did they in the birth of Tizen. Surprised? (...)</para>

        the government-procured spyware would be a serious mistake. Anti-virus software hardly
        stands a chance against such malware; some of the alerts have even turned out to be proper
        dummies.</para>

      <para>One of the great things about the original Star Wars trilogy, was the “lived in”, junky, hacked together aesthetic of the Star Wars universe. Everything was a bit trashed, as if real people actually lived there. Thankfully, that’s one of the things that George Lucas hasn’t tinkered with in his endless quest to ruin the childhood memories of a generation. So it’s heartening to see this tradition carried on with the playing of the imperial death march on miscellaneous hacked together hardware. Enjoy … (...)</para>

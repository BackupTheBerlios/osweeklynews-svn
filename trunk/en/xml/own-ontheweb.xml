      <para>REDWOOD SHORES, CA--(Marketwire - April 15, 2011) - Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ: ORCL) today is announcing its intention to move OpenOffice.org to a purely community-based open source project and to no longer offer a commercial version of Open Office.</para>
      <para>&quot;Given the breadth of interest in free personal productivity applications and the rapid evolution of personal computing technologies, we believe the OpenOffice.org project would be best managed by an organization focused on serving that broad constituency on a non-commercial basis,&quot; said Edward Screven, Oracle&apos;s Chief Corporate Architect. &quot;We intend to begin working immediately with community members to further the continued success of Open Office. Oracle will continue to strongly support the adoption of open standards-based document formats, such as the Open Document Format (ODF).&quot; (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>A jury has found that in using Linux on its back-end servers, Google has infringed a patent held by a small Texas-based company and must pay $5m in damages.

</para>
      <para>In 2006, Bedrock Computer Technologies sued Google and several other outfits – including Yahoo!, Amazon.com, PayPal, and AOL – claiming they infringed on a patent filed in January 1997. The patent describes &quot;a method and apparatus for performing storage and retrieval...that uses the hashing technique with the external chaining method for collision resolution&quot;, and the accusation is that companies infringed by using various versions of the Linux kernel on their servers.

</para>
      <para>At least some of those sued were using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on the back-end. Google apparently uses its own version of Linux across its famously distributed infrastructure.

      </title>
      <para> You know I&apos;m considering ditching Gnome for good, especially <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3.html">after</ulink> sampling the latest
        version, Gnome 3. While the <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3-fallback.html">Fallback Mode</ulink>
        offers some solace, it&apos;s a far cry from the fully usable desktop that I want and need. It&apos;s
        also a manifestation of a disturbing trend of equating power computing with the touch-screen
        nonsense of inferior mobile computing, but more about later. </para>
      <para> I&apos;m looking at all kinds of alternatives. The most prominent one isýKDE4, which has
        turned great with version 4.6. Featured in <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/pardus-2011.html">Pardus 2011</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/opensuse-11sp4-kde.html">openSUSE 11.4</ulink>,
        it&apos;s a streamlined, well-packaged environment that can almost turn a Gnome head around, back
        to the glory days when KDE reigned supreme. But there&apos;s another project you may want to
        test, and it&apos;s called Trinity KDE. </para>

      </title>
      <para>Yesterday when I <ulink url="http://ostatic.com/blog/kdes-new-project-for-portable-devices">introduced Plasma Active</ulink>, I secretly thought to myself &quot;oh no, so it&apos;s begun.&quot; See, I have this underlying fear that KDE is going to go the way of GNOME 3 and Unity and finding the removal of user choice in upcoming KDE software compilations sowed the seeds. Despite my biased first impressions, I booted the live ISO provided by open-six.

</para>
      <para>open-six used openSUSE as the basis for <ulink url="http://download.open-slx.com/iso/11.4/plasma-active.i686-1.0.6.iso">it&apos;s live CD</ulink>. It was a bit slow to boot, but truthfully, I didn&apos;t really expect it to finish. Afterall, the list of known working devices is short and I was booting on my regular desktop machine with NVIDIA graphics and two monitors. Well, it did finish booting and it even started the Plasma Active desktop. (The desktop was cloned across the two monitors - which is really best-case scenario without proprietary graphic drivers.)

</para>
      <para>And darn it all, I really hate to admit this... but my first word, my first thought was, &quot;Wow!&quot; This Plasma Active thing might really be cool on a little netbook or tablet. (...)</para>

      <para><ulink url="http://geekybodhi.net/habari/www.vuntz.net">Vincent Untz</ulink> is the uber-geek release manager for Gnome.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Mayank Sharma: What&apos;s your role in the GNOME project?</emphasis>

</para>
      <para>Vincent Untz: My current role is Release Manager of GNOME, which more or less means cheering the release team, because in the release team we all work together, and we are all on the same equal footing.

</para>
      <para>The release team exists to make sure that we release Gnome on time with the quality we all expect, and to make important decisions when decisions need to be taken, like which new modules are to be part of Gnome, to publish the schedule for the release cycle, and everything that is related to release engineering a big project like Gnome. Because Gnome is actually made of more than 100 modules, so it&apos;s really a lot of coordination between the modules to make sure everything works.

</para>
      <para>So that&apos;s my main role. I am also maintaining a few modules, and doing many other things. (...)</para>

      <para>I have to admit, over the years I haven’t given openSUSE enough love or credit for being
        the outstanding Linux distribution is it. With that said, I wanted to give some attention to
        the latest release coming out of the openSUSE project. And, since the default desktop for
        openSUSE 11.4 is KDE, I will be giving a little extra attention to the KDE desktop. Since
        both might well gain some serious ground, when Ubuntu 11.04 is released, it will be nice for
        users to not only know of its existence, but to also know that openSUSE 11.4 is, in fact, a
        solid distribution worth giving a look. (...)</para>

          Akonadi Google Resource: complete rewrite</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>today I finally pushed a completely new version of the Akonadi Google Resource. Since
        last update cca 2 months ago I’ve completely rewritten the resources, moving most of the
        functionality into libKGoogle . The library now provides access to Google services and can
        be easily used by any other project. So what’s new? A lot of things changed for programmers.
        I’ve begun to fulfill my threats about providing a C++/Qt library for accessing Google
        Services. It’s not pure Qt, I’m using some KDE stuff in there, but that will change.</para>
      <para>LibKGoogle now provides API similar to QNetworkAccessManager (KGoogleAccessManager)
        through which you can send KGoogleRequest and if it works, you’ll receive a KGoogleReply.
        Each Google Service is represented by a KGoogleService subclass, implementing XML and/or
        JSON parser and serializer and providing informations about fetch/create/update URLs. Each
        object (contact, event, calendar) is represented by KGoogleObject subclass. For now, Event
        class is implements KCalCore::Event as well, the Calendar and Contact classes provide their
        own implementation of everything. Porting it to KABC/KCalCore is on TODO. (...)</para>

        operating system, he just wanted to explore the capabilities of his PC's 386 processor.

        Linux</ulink></title>
      <para>The Linux kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science
        student, and first announced to the world on August 25, 1991—exactly 20 years ago today. At
        the time, Torvalds described his work as a "hobby" and contended that it would not be "big
        and professional" like the GNU project.</para>
      <para>But the Linux kernel turned out to be one of the most significant pieces of open source
        software ever developed. Over the past two decades, it has grown from a humble hobby project
        into a global phenomenon that runs on everything from low-cost e-book readers to a majority
        of the world's supercomputers. Here's how it grew.</para>

        However, Amarok 2.4.3 has revamped the dynamic playlists engine and interface, so I wanted
        to check it out and see if it worked better as well as testing out some of the new features.
        For one thing, they changed the interface to more closely match the interface for static
        playlists. See:</para>

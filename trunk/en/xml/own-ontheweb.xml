      </title>
      <para>Welcome to the Qtest Mobile App Port! As developers of applications using Qt, you
        already know how great it is to work with - but how about on mobile platforms, such as
        Symbian and MeeGo? How would you like to take that step you have been wanting to take, but
        not been able to justify: Take your application from the desktop and bring it into the
        hand-held world via the Ovi store. Let this contest be the justification, with the
        possibility of a new phone or even 10,000 euros waiting at the end. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Dates</emphasis>: The contest starts on 20th of December, 2010,
        and runs till 28th of February. The 31st of December is important for you if you wish to
        take part in the Early Bird competition. If you do no win, you will still take part in the
        main competition, and will be allowed to continue your work and submit new versions to the
        Ovi Store. The 28th of February is the deadline for taking part in the main
        competition.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Developer Sprint</emphasis>: There will be a sponsored developer
        sprint organized together with the KDE e.V. during the competition. The travel and stay can
        be paid for if you do not have the budget yourself. Further details will be made public at a
        later time, and all participants will be notified of this information via email. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Judging and prizes</emphasis>: The Qtest Mobile App Port is
        evaluated by a panel of judges which will be announced in the next few days. The jury will
        pic 5 winners at 31th of December as the early bird winners. Every winner gets a free N900
        phone. The main competition first prize is EUR 10,000, which will be awarded to the
        application which the judges find to be the best ported application. The second to sixth
        price will be another 5 N900 phones.</para>

      <para>And, finally: Everybody who takes part in the competition will be awarded a gift bag,
        with a T-shirt and other merchandise.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Eligibility</emphasis>: To be able to take part in the contest,
        the ported application must be submitted for Ovi Store signing by one of the two deadlines:
        - Early bird entries must be submitted by December 31st - Standard entries must be submitted
        by February 28th.</para>
      <para>You also have to submit your application to the &quot;Mobile Contest&quot; category on
        Qt-Apps.org or MeeGo-Central.org </para>
      <para>You can submit your application to the Ovi Store as many times as you wish during the
        competition. This allows you to get feedback from the public on your software. It´s possible
        to submit new or existing KDE/Qt applications.</para>
      <para>So have fun and good luck everybody!</para>

      <para>There are lots of graphics software applications out there. Photoshop is the big dog on
        the block and many professional artists, cartoonists, and film makers use it for a variety
        of tasks. There are also graphics applications that rival Photoshop and do just about as
        much as Photoshop but a t a lower cost. It all depends on the job you’re tackling and how
        many digital tools you require. </para>
      <para>I’ve found that <ulink url="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</ulink> does just about all I
        need when producing my comic features. And the costs is much less than Photoshop. Gimp is

      </title>
      <para>Mozilla has the finish line for Firefox 4 in sight: Beta 9 was just released and the
        first builds of Beta 10 have been posted to the company’s FTP server. There are just over
        100 blocking bugs left and there isn’t much that will change until the final release will be
        available sometime in February or March. Time to check how fast this new browser is. The
        first article of this series focuses on JavaScript performance.</para>
      <para>It has been almost 9 months since Firefox 4 was first announced and Mozilla has covered
        a lot of ground and has overcome significant obstacles to come up with a competitive browser
        that returns to what has made Firefox great: A fast and nimble browser with features that
        are setting the standard for everyone else. One key requirement for Firefox 4 was to catch
        up with its rivals as it was clear early last year that 3.6.x wasn’t up to the task anymore.
        Before we are looking at Firefox 4′ features, we will have a look at its performance
        capability. Firefox 4 Beta 10-pre is pretty darn close to the final version and should give
        us a good idea how the browser stacks up. (...)</para>

      <para>Well, these questions didn't go over real well. Marques was a <ulink

          Sirko Kemter</ulink> and raised questions of fairness in the decision of the Board to
        terminate him. His choice of questions days later seemed to revolve around fairness,
        freedom, and rights. He received a few answers but none from other Board nominees. </para>
      <para>Most answers expressed objection to the nature of the questions and motives behind them.
        One respondent called them <quote>stranger than fiction</quote>. Another said it was
          <quote>over the top</quote> and one other called it a <quote>passive-aggressive attack on
          the existing board</quote>. He suggested Marques share what else he was going to do for
        openSUSE in his two year term other than trying to reinstate his friend. Most just wanted to
        stick to things directly relevant to the job of serving on the Board much like the questions
        from Vincent Untz. </para>
      <para>He asked things like:<itemizedlist>

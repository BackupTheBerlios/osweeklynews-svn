          Release Candidate</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>June 25th, 2011. Today, KDE has released a release candidate of the upcoming 4.7 release
        of the Plasma Desktop and Netbook workspaces, the KDE Applications and the KDE Frameworks,
        which is planned for July 27, 2011. With API, dependency and feature freezes in place, the
        KDE team's focus is now on fixing last-minute showstopper bugs and finishing translation and
        documentation that comes along with the releases. (...)</para>

      <para>I’ve liked <ulink url="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new">Firefox</ulink> since

        concerns me. Oh, it’s a fine browser. But, it’s not a major new release. At most, I’d call

      <para>The Mozilla Foundation, following in the footsteps of <ulink url="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google’s Chrome Web browser</ulink>, seems to believe
        that if they keep popping out new “major” releases every six weeks, they’ll convince people
        they’re better than the competition. That seemed like a dumb idea to me when Microsoft went
        from Word for Windows 2.0 to Word for Windows 6.0 back in 1993. The idea hasn’t improved any
        with age. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>These days, more and more people work at home at least part of the time. According to
        the U.S. Small Business Administration, more than half of the 29.6 million small businesses
        in the country are home-based.</para>
      <para>If you add to those figures the number of people who telecommute to their jobs part of
        the time, the Telework Research Network estimates that between 20 to 30 million people work
        from home at least once a week. And WorldatWork claims that approximately 44 million
        Americans work at home at least one day a year.</para>
      <para>Whether they work for themselves, a small business or a large multinational corporation,
        all of these workers need good software for their home offices. And many of these people who
        work at home don&apos;t have a lot of money to spend on that software -- especially if they work
        for themselves.</para>
      <para>With those workers in mind, we&apos;ve created a list of open source applications that are
        the most helpful for home offices. Unlike many of our other Datamation lists, we&apos;ve kept the
        number of applications in each category small—usually just the one or two top apps in each
        category. Nearly all of this software will run on Windows, and these are some of the most
        mature and user-friendly open source applications available. If you&apos;re reasonably
        tech-savvy, you should be able to set up and use any of these apps.</para>
      <para>Also, recognizing that home office computers get used for more than just work, we&apos;ve
        included a mix of business software, utilities, and &quot;fun&quot; apps for those times when you need
        a break.</para>
      <para>As always, if you&apos;d like to recommend another open source app that we&apos;ve missed, feel
        free to add a comment below. (...)</para>

      <para>Probably the most boring open source story recently has also been the one getting the

      <para>Oracle’s “gift” of OpenOffice.org to Apache, and the change of license from copyleft to

      <para>Picking a Linux distribution isn&apos;t always easy. It&apos;s one of the most common hurdles for new and aspiring Linux users, deciding which distribution is going to be right for them. With so many to choose from, how do you pick the right one? Let&apos;s start with an overview of the major Linux distros, and you&apos;ll be ready to jump in right away.</para>
      <para>You can find <emphasis role="italic">hundreds</emphasis> of Linux distributions, depending on what your needs are. For this scorecard, we&apos;re focusing on desktop distributions that are fairly popular, well-supported, and have a reliable release history, and strong community. In <ulink url="http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/biz-enterprise/313053-the-spring-2010-linux-distro-scorecard">last year&apos;s scorecard</ulink>, we started with seven distros — this year, we&apos;ve narrowed the field to six distributions:

      <para>When writing documentation for GNU/Linux or any other FOSS project it makes sense to license it under some sort of Free license. Doing so will allow others to redistribute and build on it. But with the plethora of Free Documentation licenses available it can be confusing to choose the right one for you. This article will explain the differences among some of the most common licenses so that you can make the best choice.</para>
      <para>The licenses discussed here can, and often are, used for a variety of different forms of expression, but for the purpose of this article we will only focus on how they apply to the written word. (...)</para>

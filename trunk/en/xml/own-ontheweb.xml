      </title>
      <para>First I’d like to thank David Vignoni for his work on the logo for the Randa meeting.
        It’s the basis for the work of the <ulink url="http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/?p=121">young informatic trainees</ulink>. But the results are still secret (as even I haven’t seen
        anything myself but get the first results at the end of this week <inlinemediaobject>

      <para>And now to the ideas and proposals (btw this has nothing in common with the <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2011/Ideas">GSoC ideas of KDE</ulink>!). As you
        probably or hopefully already know the <ulink url="http://nepomuk.kde.org">KDE Nepomuk team</ulink> will have a meeting in <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Sprints/Randa">Randa</ulink> this June (from the 1st to the 7th of this month) and we still want
        application developers to integrate this technology in their application or to work on some
        interesting and great new ideas. And there will be really good help as <ulink url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/">Sebastian Trýg</ulink> will be in Randa and he is going
        to do one or the other workshop of Nepomuk basics. And here are some ideas and thoughts of
        mine to start your imagination engines:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The KDE semantic clipboard. There is <ulink url="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/base/nepomuk-kde/semclip/">some code</ulink> in the old subversion playground of KDE and in December 2010 I wrote a
              <ulink url="http://blogs.fsfe.org/mario/thesis_template.pdf">paper</ulink> about this
            topic. In short, this clipboard enhances to normal one with the capability of knowing
            what (in the context of meaning) it copy-and-pastes. This clipboard does not just copy
            numbers and formatting but addresses, geographic coordinates or blbliographic
            references. Take a look and bring it to a releasable state. There are even some solution
            proposals in the above mentioned paper.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>All of the new <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM">KDE PIM</ulink>
            application use Nepomuk technology through their <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Akonadi">Akonadi</ulink> interactions.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><ulink url="http://www.digikam.org">Digikam</ulink> had (or has?) some capabilities
            to exchange its information and metadata with the Nepomuk storage. What about tagging
            your pictures with the contacts (and <ulink url="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/pimo/">PIMO::Persons</ulink>) of the
            new Kaddressbook and projects which are then usable system wide.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>And <ulink url="http://amarok.kde.org">Amarok</ulink> had (or again has?) some
            functions to share it’s music database with Nepomuk and thus make it system wide and not
            just enclosed in one applicatition.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>But there are as well good examples for existing Nepomuk integration: <ulink url="http://bangarangkde.wordpress.com/">Bangarang</ulink>. A multimedia player which
            remembers what you like, what music and videos you have on your system and where is more
            information about this media data (in the web).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Another idea could be a (scientific) paper or article collector which understands
            the connections (or quotations) between the articles and that the strings at the top
            (authors) are actually persons and the references at the end of the articles are
            actually links and thus relations to other papers and articles. Take a look at the
              <ulink url="http://ontoware.org/swrc/">SWRC ontology</ulink>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Yet another project which extensively uses Nepomuk is the new <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Real-Time_Communication_and_Collaboration">KDE Telepathy framework</ulink>. They don’t just invent yet another represenation of a person and
            its contacts but use PIMO::Person and thus make connections to them system wide
            comprehensible and reusable.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>And let’s not forget the <ulink url="http://plasma.kde.org">Plasma framework</ulink>
            and its <ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Activities">activities</ulink>. But
            there is more and better information about this on the <ulink url="http://ivan.fomentgroup.org/blog/">site of ivan Cukic</ulink>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Or something completely new. An ontology for TV series, recordings and shows…
            (Update: Sebastian told me that there is already one: <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/oscaf/ticket/44">NMM</ulink>. And Bangarang and
            some other applications use it.)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>And there is <ulink url="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">Zeitgeist</ulink> and <ulink url="http://releases.zeitgeist-project.com/qzeitgeist/">QtZeitgeist</ulink>…

      <para><emphasis role="bold">The addition of ipset support makes it easier to run a firewall,
          as it means that only one table needs to be modified in order to block a specific IP
          address. The situation with regard to drivers for WLAN chips continues to improve, with
          Ralink and Realtek now actively involved in developing the Linux kernel
          drivers.</emphasis></para>

        versions of Linux kernel 2.6.39 both note a comparative lack of changes. The calm prior to
        the RC2 release even prompted him to speculate whether the kernel developers were "up to
        something". More jocularity of this ilk was evident on the release of RC3 on Tuesday, but
        both emails make it clear that he welcomes the tranquillity and is looking forward to a
        quiet development cycle.</para>
      <para>As usual, the bulk of the changes in the next major kernel revision found their way into
        the main development tree during the merge window. Kernel Log is therefore already in a
        position to offer a comprehensive overview of the major changes in kernel 2.6.39, scheduled
        for release in mid to late May. A range of articles will deal with different functional
        areas of the kernel in turn. The "Coming in 2.6.39" series opens here with the major changes
        in the network stack and associated drivers. Over the next few weeks, this will be followed
        by articles covering graphics drivers, storage support, file systems, architecture code,
        infrastructure and drivers for other hardware. (...)</para>

        <ulink url="http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2011/04/review-gnome-3.html"> dasublogbyprashanth: Review: GNOME 3 </ulink>
      </title>
      <para>About 2 months ago, I <ulink url="http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2011/02/preview-gnome-3.html">previewed</ulink> GNOME 3. At that time, it was many weeks away from the final release,
        so there were still many things to be done. Since then, many things have changed, and a few
        days ago, GNOME 3 was finally released for the whole world to see. </para>
      <para>The biggest change in GNOME 3 is of course the GNOME 3 Shell. This has gotten several
        changes, updates, and other revisions through its development. Since then, however, a GNOME
        3 fallback mode has also been added. One of the common complaints about GNOME 3 has been
        that the new Mutter WM requires 3D effects to work correctly, and not all computers have
        this, especially older ones. This is where GNOME 3 fallback mode comes in, so in addition to
        trying out GNOME 3 Shell, I have also tried GNOME 3 fallback mode. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>Key KDE developers have been blogging about new projects aimed towards portable devices.
        As Aaron Seigo <ulink url="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/04/plasma-active-quick.html">says</ulink>, <quote>In a nutshell, Plasma Active is about getting the KDE Platform with Plasma providing a compelling user interface ready for and available on hardware devices outside the usual laptop and desktop form factors.</quote> For us mortals, that means an
        interface for smartphones, tablets, and handhelds.</para>
      <para>Dubbed <quote>Plasma Active</quote>, the new initative encompasses several components to
        build a <quote>data-centric user interface which is not concerned with applications but rather offers intelligently combined data through a context-sensitive recommendation manager.</quote> One might compare it to MeeGO. Marco Martin <ulink url="http://www.notmart.org/index.php/BlaBla/Reactivate">said</ulink> the name of the
        project gives a hint to its future. He said, <quote>An important thing comes already in the name: it&apos;s Plasma Active and not Plasma Mobile: why? What we are doing right now is exactly a mobile project: tablets to be precise, but stopping there would be a mistake. Our goal is to be sure that if an application is &quot;certified to be active&quot; can run as well in a tablet, as in an handheld device, as in a set top box, as in a type of device we have completely no idea about, once an user interface module specific for its screen size and input method has been added.</quote> (...)</para>

      <para>I have to admit, over the years I haven’t given openSUSE enough love or credit for being
        the outstanding Linux distribution is it. With that said, I wanted to give some attention to
        the latest release coming out of the openSUSE project. And, since the default desktop for
        openSUSE 11.4 is KDE, I will be giving a little extra attention to the KDE desktop. Since
        both might well gain some serious ground, when Ubuntu 11.04 is released, it will be nice for
        users to not only know of its existence, but to also know that openSUSE 11.4 is, in fact, a
        solid distribution worth giving a look. (...)</para>

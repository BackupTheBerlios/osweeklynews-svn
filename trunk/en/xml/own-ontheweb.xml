          Introducing Dolphin 2.0</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>During the last months I've been working on Dolphin 2.0 which is planned to get released
        with the 4.8 release of KDE Applications. Dolphin 2.0 will get a new "view-engine" that will
        have several improvements in comparison to the current version.</para>
      <para>Well, what means "view-engine" in the scope of Dolphin? The view-engine is responsible
        for showing the directory content as icons and text. In a very simplified form it can be
        seen as the sum of Dolphin's "icons mode", "details mode" and "columns mode". (...)</para>

      <para>It was big news when the 3.0 kernel was released at the end of July, but as luck would
        have it, another fundamental piece of your average distribution is about to bump its own
        version number up to 3.0 as well: the <ulink
          url="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/lsb/fhs">filesystem hierarchy
          standard</ulink> (FHS). If you're not sure exactly what that means or why you should care,
        don't worry. It's the distros that implement the FHS — when it goes well, all you know is
        that your system runs smoothly. But that doesn't mean there's nothing important hidden away
        in this new release. (...)</para>

      <para>I&#160;almost bought an Android phone. I hesitated, wondering whether it would be
        upgradeable to 2.2 or 2.3? I am not in the habit of changing phones even once a year. So, I
        got myself a phone that is, well, ‘just a phone’. Upon reflection, all I needed was the
        ability to receive calls and SMS messages and, rarely, make some calls. If I couldn’t
        upgrade the software versions, its value as a playground for experimenting with mobile
        applications was very limited. (...)</para>

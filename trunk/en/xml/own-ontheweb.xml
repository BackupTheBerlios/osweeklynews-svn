      <para>Apart from being a tasty Bavarian bread-snack, Bretzn is a code-name for a collection of technology aimed at solving a problem which has existed 
        in software development for a very long time: How do you get your applications build for all available platforms and get it to your users?</para>
      <para>In the open source community, we already have many individual bits of this dream in place. We the great cross platform toolkit Qt, we have the powerful openSuse 
        Build Service which allows for the easy creation of binaries for a great number of Linux distributions, we have the Open Collaboration Services (OCS) which allows 
        for the easy and socially adept distribution of packages both to and from central software download sites such as KDE-Apps.org, and we have a great many powerful 
        integrated development enviromnents such as Qt Creator, KDevelop and Eclipse.</para>
      <para>In the spring of 2010 these many powerful and successful technologies and tools made up mostly isolated islands, and it seemed the obvious choice to begin the 
        process of bridging them. Finally, in August the same year, the project was begun and and announced during the openSUSE conference in October. Project Bretzn would 
        make it possible, with a few clicks, to publish software projects directly from the IDE. The development of this project is sponsored by Nokia. (...)</para>

      <para>Open Invention Network was founded as a way to help defend the Linux ecosystem, and by
        extension much of the Free and Open Source software world, from the risks associated with
        software patents. Patents owned by Open Invention Network are available royalty-free to any
        company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against the Linux
        System, creating an umbrella of protection for its members.</para>
      <para><quote>We view an OIN license as one of the key methods through which open source innovators can deter patent aggression,” said Adriaan de Groot, vice president of KDE. “We are committed to freedom of action in Linux, and in taking a license we help to address the threat from companies that support proprietary platforms to the exclusion of open source initiatives, and whose behaviors reflect a disdain for inventiveness and collaboration.</quote></para>
      <para><quote>Given its leadership in creating a user-friendly computing experience, including its advanced graphical desktop for the Linux community, we are pleased to have KDE become a licensee,” said Keith Bergelt, CEO of Open Invention Network. “By doing so, KDE affirms its continued support for open source. We applaud their foresight in taking this step to support both itself and the open source community broadly.</quote></para>
      <para>While KDE maintains our position against software patents, this development provides an
        additional safety net for KDE when it comes to the risks Free Software is facing from such

        <ulink url="http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.6-rc1.php">KDE Software Compilation 4.6 RC1 Released: Codename Chanukkah</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>December 23rd, 2010. Right before christmas, KDE has published the first candidate for
        the upcoming release of KDE 4.6.0. The focus at this stage is on fixing bugs and completing
        translations and artwork. As such, the rework of the Oxygen icon set is nearing completion,
        many bugs reported by testers in the past weeks have been fixed and stabilization is still
        in full swing. KDE&apos;s release team has decided to not include the new release of
        KDE-PIM, containing the Kontact groupware client and the new KMail2 which is based on the
        Akonadi groupware cache in this release due to open issue with migration of large sets of
        data from the traditional client. These bugs are being worked on as we speak, but the risk
        at this point is too high to include the new Kontact in the 4.6.0 release. Therefore, it has
        been decided to release KMail2 and its companions together with one of the subsequent 4.6
        releases, likely 4.6.1 one month later. A 3rd beta version of the kdepim module is available
        already. As the other components of the frameworks, workspaces and applications are nearing
        release date, KDE encourages testers to give their favorite software some final thorough
        testing. The last chance for feedback will be the second release candidate, planned for
        January, 5th 2011. The final release of 4.6.0 will be <ulink url="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/4365">available</ulink> on January, 26th 2011. </para>

      </title>
      <para>Welcome to the Qtest Mobile App Port! As developers of applications using Qt, you
        already know how great it is to work with - but how about on mobile platforms, such as
        Symbian and MeeGo? How would you like to take that step you have been wanting to take, but
        not been able to justify: Take your application from the desktop and bring it into the
        hand-held world via the Ovi store. Let this contest be the justification, with the
        possibility of a new phone or even 10,000 euros waiting at the end. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Dates</emphasis>: The contest starts on 20th of December, 2010,
        and runs till 28th of February. The 31st of December is important for you if you wish to
        take part in the Early Bird competition. If you do no win, you will still take part in the
        main competition, and will be allowed to continue your work and submit new versions to the
        Ovi Store. The 28th of February is the deadline for taking part in the main
        competition.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Developer Sprint</emphasis>: There will be a sponsored developer
        sprint organized together with the KDE e.V. during the competition. The travel and stay can
        be paid for if you do not have the budget yourself. Further details will be made public at a
        later time, and all participants will be notified of this information via email. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Judging and prizes</emphasis>: The Qtest Mobile App Port is
        evaluated by a panel of judges which will be announced in the next few days. The jury will
        pic 5 winners at 31th of December as the early bird winners. Every winner gets a free N900
        phone. The main competition first prize is EUR 10,000, which will be awarded to the
        application which the judges find to be the best ported application. The second to sixth
        price will be another 5 N900 phones.</para>

        the ported application must be submitted for Ovi Store signing by one of the two deadlines:
        - Early bird entries must be submitted by December 31st - Standard entries must be submitted
        by February 28th.</para>
      <para>You also have to submit your application to the &quot;Mobile Contest&quot; category on
        Qt-Apps.org or MeeGo-Central.org </para>
      <para>You can submit your application to the Ovi Store as many times as you wish during the
        competition. This allows you to get feedback from the public on your software. It´s possible
        to submit new or existing KDE/Qt applications.</para>
      <para>So have fun and good luck everybody!</para>

      </title>
      <para>I&apos;ve been thinking and thinking about everything, and I&apos;ve figured out what I need to
        explain to you next. Reading <ulink url="http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-project/2010/opensuse-project.2010-12-15-19.01.log.html">the log</ulink> of the recent OpenSUSE board meeting discussing setting up a foundation
        for the project turned on the light in my head: you need to understand bylaws. Because
        corporations are setting up foundations to get you to donate code to them, and they set them
        up to suit themselves, not to benefit you. There&apos;s a difference between the community
        setting up a foundation to be a project&apos;s home and a corporate sponsor doing it. I&apos;m going
        to write about that in more detail later. To really explain it, I need to explain some
        things that you might think will be boring or too foreign, but if you can learn Perl, you
        can learn bylaws.</para>
      <para>I&apos;ll tell you that my favorite task when I was working as a paralegal was drawing up
        bylaws for new businesses and entities setting up for the first time. It interests me, so
        I&apos;ll try to make it interesting to you. But what should motivate you is this: whatever the
        bylaws say is what the entity legally can and can&apos;t do. It matters. It will affect you. So,
        just as you&apos;d try to learn a language before visiting a foreign country, at least enough to
        get around so that if you get lost, you&apos;ll have some way to find your hotel again and a
        bathroom en route, you should understand enough about bylaws and incorporation so no one can
        blindside you.</para>
      <para>I&apos;m still working on the Comes v. Microsoft exhibits project, and I swore I&apos;d finish
        first, so it will take me a while to get to this to explain in detail, but in the meantime,
        I just want to say to the community stakeholders in the OpenSUSE Project, here&apos;s what I
        think you should do:</para>
      <tip>
        <para>Hire your own lawyer. Don&apos;t rely on Novell&apos;s lawyers to represent the community&apos;s
          interests in the foundation. (...)</para>

        something.<xref linkend="fig.edu"/></para>
      <para>With Linux, there&apos;s no vendor lock-in. Free software is more likely to be open-standards compliant, and it&apos;s going to be more open to different languages, localities 
        and curricula.</para>
      <para>It also removes what can sometimes be a barrier to learning; using the same software on your own machine at home. And because there&apos;s usually more than one piece of 
      open source software for a job, free software makes it easier to broaden your experience and look at a variety of methods for completing that job.</para>
      <para>All of which is essential in a world where technology is turned on its head every five years and where training needs are so unpredictable. It&apos;s also never too early 
      to start training in IT skills, and in the UK at least, computer training starts for many at primary school level.</para>
      <para>For some, this will be their first experience of a computer. It&apos;s also likely to be the first time they&apos;ve had any kind of formal training on how to use one, and 
      these first impressions are going to last. So there&apos;s a strong argument that teaching should be as unbiased as possible.</para>
      <para>Yet for a variety of reasons most schools favour Microsoft. There&apos;s nothing wrong with this, as experience with Microsoft&apos;s ubiquitous products is never going to be 
      wasted, but as Linux users, we all know there might be a better option.</para>
      <para>Linux and open source offers a genuine alternative, with many advantages over proprietary training that aren&apos;t costrelated, although there&apos;s no reason why this can&apos;t 
        be part of the overall solution. (...)</para>

      <para>There are often reports regarding concerns about computer games having negative effects on children and adults, with the fear that these games can lead to violent 
        behaviour and addiction. However, studies by leading researchers have shown that there are many positive attributes to playing computer games, some of which we have 
        alluded to in our earlier articles. Computer games can help players to improve their cognitive skills, enhance creativity, deepen language and maths skills, and help 
        people to think on their feet and outside the box, the latter referring to novel, creative and smart thinking. However, above all these things, games offer pure, 
        unadulterated fun. </para>
      <para>Linux is vastly underrated as a gaming platform. This may be due to the fact that there is no significant marketing of Linux games. With a lack of big-name 
        games featuring in the computing press, coupled with a low market share for Linux on desktop PCs, things might seem bleak, with major barriers to the 
        growth of Linux games.</para>
      <para>However, the reality is that Linux has a huge range of games (predominately free to download). Whilst they do not gain much publicity, many of them offer 
        real depth and gameplay. The purpose of this three part article is to help draw attention to these unsung gems. (...)</para>

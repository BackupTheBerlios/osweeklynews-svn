        Windows and Linux interoperation and support. The new accord sees the relationship extended
        four years through to 1&#160;Jan&#160;2016. The renewal of the deal confirms that the newly

        Linux distro SUSE in $100 million increments, and included an agreement that Novell’s

        to 2.2 or 2.3? I am not in the habit of changing phones even once a year. So, I got myself a
        phone that is, well, ‘just a phone’. Upon reflection, all I needed was the ability to
        receive calls and SMS messages and, rarely, make some calls. If I couldn’t upgrade the
        software versions, its value as a playground for experimenting with mobile applications was
        very limited. (...)</para>

        <ulink url="http://dot.kde.org/2011/03/03/qt-and-future-kde">KDE News/Cornelius Schumacher: Qt and the Future of KDE</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Following <ulink url="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/02/11/open-letter-from-ceo-stephen-elop-nokia-and-ceo-steve-ballmer-microsoft/">Nokia&apos;s recent announcement</ulink> about its future smart phone development strategy, KDE has received a lot of questions. Many of these questions have been related to the future of 
      KDE and KDE&apos;s commitment to the Qt framework. In this statement we set out what we see as a bright future for Qt and KDE software.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Qt</emphasis></para>
      <para>We chose Qt in 1996 because it offered the best software development framework. Today, it still does. Over the last fifteen years, KDE has worked to ensure that Qt 
        will always be available, leading to the creation of agreements such as that which underpins the <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php">KDE Free Qt Foundation</ulink>. The future of Qt has been further strengthened in recent years by 
        Nokia&apos;s decisions to release it under the LGPL and begin the process of giving the community greater influence through Open Governance. We are working with our partners 
        to speed up this process and make <ulink url="http://qt-labs.org/index.php/Main_Page">Open Governance</ulink> a reality. In the meantime, we welcome Nokia&apos;s ongoing 
        commitment to Qt, as well as their continued support of KDE, as <ulink url="http://ev.kde.org/supporting-members.php">a Patron</ulink> and as a sponsor of our annual 
        conference.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE</emphasis></para>
      <para>Today, KDE faces new challenges and opportunities. Traditional desktop and laptop computers are no longer the only means for users to work on documents, entertain 
        themselves and interact socially. Innovations such as netbooks, tablets and increasingly capable smart phones have changed computer use, introducing new form factors and 
        new use cases. For the first time since KDE was founded, we have the chance to shape the nature of computer use, rather than competing with established computing 
        paradigms.</para>
      <para>Our Plasma framework puts us in a strong position to develop innovative and beautiful user interfaces for smart phones, in-vehicle systems, desktop computers, 
        portable computers, home media centers and more. Few, if any, of our competitors have an application and user interface framework that is as portable, attractive and 
        easy to develop with as ours. At the heart of Plasma and the portability of our applications is Qt. Code developed for one platform can run with minimal changes on 
        legacy platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Max OS X and, crucially, on Linux and other free platforms that can scale from the handheld device to the desktop 
        powerhouse. Recent innovations in Qt, such as Qt Quick, make it easier than ever for designers as well as developers to turn their ideas into applications and offer them 
        to users. KDE is only just beginning to take advantage of these new opportunities.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Future</emphasis></para>
      <para>Qt remains the strong, cross-platform foundation of everything we do. Combined with KDE technologies, we believe Qt is the compelling framework for cross-platform 
        software development. There has never been a better time to shape the future of computing. <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/community/getinvolved/">Join us</ulink> and 
        make that future a future that is free.</para>

        </note>&quot;Joe “Zonker” Brockmeier wrote an <ulink url="http://www.networkworld.com/community/banshee-amazon-store-disabled-by-canonical-in-ubuntu">interesting article</ulink> on Open Source Report about the Banshee Amazon store in
        Ubuntu 11.04. To quickly summarize the situation, Banshee will be the new default music
        player in Ubuntu. Let me say up front, as a disclaimer: Banshee is to a large extent being
        developed by my employer, Novell. Banshee has support for the Amazon music store and
        includes a referral code in there, as you’d expect. The benefits of this amount to around
        $10,000 per year right now, which goes to the GNOME Foundation. Sadly, Canonical recently
        visited the Banshee mailing list and told them the Amazon store had to go. It could stay,
        they said, but only if Banshee gave 75% of the earnings to Canonical instead of GNOME. The
        Banshee developers graciously declined. Now Banshee (in Ubuntu at least) will have Ubuntu
        One as default music store and users will have to enable Amazon by themselves.

      <para><note>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Copyright © 2011 Consortiuminfo.org. All rights reserved.</emphasis></para>
        </note>&quot;For some time now, I have been meaning to write a series of blog posts setting
        forth my views on best practices in forming and governing open source foundations. Why?
        Because despite the increasing reliance of just about every part of our modern world
        (government, finance, defense, and so on) on open source software (OSS) and Free and Open
        Source Software (FOSS), there has been very little written on the subject. </para>
      <para>That means that neither a community nor a corporation has much to refer to in creating
        the kind of governance structure most likely to ensure that the intentions of the founders
        are carried out, that the rights of contributors are respected, and that the code upon which
        end users will rely is properly maintained into the future. (...)&quot;</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">© 1994 - 2011 ITworld. All rights reserved.</emphasis></para>
        </note>&quot;When I read with disappointed interest the news that the <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/No-more-desktop-Linux-systems-in-the-German-Foreign-Office-1191122.html">German Foreign Office had decided to migrate back to Windows</ulink> after having
        deployed Linux on their office desktops in 2005, my immediate reaction was one of
        resignation. </para>
      <para>That&apos;s a change from my younger days, when I would see such reverse migrations as
        carefully staged Microsoft PR events designed purposely to embarrass Linux on the desktop. I
        would hear comments such as &quot;it was too hard to train users&quot; on Linux and cries of
        &quot;FUD!&quot; and &quot;Hokum!&quot; would sail out from my keyboard. </para>
      <para>Training people to use Linux, I would reason, is no harder than training them to use
        Windows or OS X. Any statements to the contrary, I would further argue, were merely playing
        to the cameras. Such brashness came from my experience in learning all sorts of platforms
        from scratch. And there&apos;s where I went wrong. (...)&quot;</para>

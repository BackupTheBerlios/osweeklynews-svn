      <para>LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve the suite’s functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.</para>
      <para>Since, at the moment, there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites. Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community, and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.</para>

      <para>Tired of burning a new CD every time a new version of your favourite Linux distro comes out? Then stop. Use NetbootCD to download and install your choice of <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tags/debian/">Debian</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fedora-15-bringing-latest-linux/">Fedora</ulink>, openSUSE, Mandriva, CentOS or Slackware from a single disk. This handy disk downloads and runs the net installation tools for several distros, and is always capable of finding the latest version of your Linux operating system. Burn this tool once and you’ll never need to burn a Linux distro to CD again.</para>
      <para>Using NetbootCD isn’t necessarily easy. You’ll need to learn to use text-based installers instead of the GUI versions found on live CDs. To me though, this is a small price to pay to contain my steadily-growing pile of Linux CDs. (...)</para>

      <para>What does the <ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516">Windows 8 Developer Preview</ulink> have to do with the Linux desktop? Not much, you might think at first, especially since the final version is likely to be vastly different than the preview.</para>
      <para>But as I explored the preview, I couldn&apos;t help asking myself: is this the first hint of how major desktops will look in the future on all operating systems? It&apos;s a distinct and -- for a Linux desktop user -- an alarming possibility.</para>

      <para>The preview is really two desktops in one. One is a standard Windows desktop that differs little from Windows 7. The other is the default Metro API, which resembles the <ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-ca/default.aspx">Windows Phone</ulink>. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>High context cultures value personal relationships over process. You have to know someone before you can trust them and work with them. They also tend to be less explicit and rely more on tone of voice, gestures and even status to communicate. Typically Asian countries are more high context than Western countries. Think Korea and Japan.</para>
      <para>Low context cultures are process driven. They rely on facts and processes. Their communication style is much more direct and action-orientated. They are orientated towards the individual rather than the group. Western cultures like the US and Germany are considered low context. (...)</para>

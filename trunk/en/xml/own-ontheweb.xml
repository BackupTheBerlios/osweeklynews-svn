      <para>Linux Foundation’s newest members represent Linux’s ubiquity and adaptability across
        industries</para>
      <para>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., July 13 2011 – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization
        dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux, today announced that four new members are
        joining the organization: basysKom, Codero, Gluster and Nixu Open.</para>
      <para>These four companies represent the diverse environments in which Linux is accelerating
        technology innovation. The Linux operating system today powers the majority of the world’s
        stock exchanges, websites and supercomputers. It is also the foundation for next-generation
        mobile devices and embedded systems, while enabling new innovations such as the smart grid
        and highly visible technology advancements such as IBM’s Watson Supercomputer.</para>
      <para>Today’s new Linux Foundation members represent three distinct opportunities for the
        Linux operating system: to ensure security and application development across mobile and
        embedded systems, as a key component of hosted IT and web services, and as the foundation
        for storage in today’s maturing enterprise. (...)</para>

      <para>Some people may remember the old Qt.labs.particles module. It was left in labs because
        we thought we could create a better particle system later, and didn’t want to tie ourselves
        into that first attempt (but of course, we had to have a particle system somewhere; it’s a
        modern essential!). With the graphical power of scenegraph, the shader fairies are now
        creating that better system. As it’s in the unreleased and unstable Qt5 though, it’s still
        only labs quality – but that doesn’t stop me from sharing it on labs <mediaobject>

      <para>As usual I ran into a couple more issues this past week that prevented me from
        completing many of the items on my Todo list. I also forgot to finish a couple of things
        like copying files, because it isn’t part of the web frontend.</para>
      <para>First, I’d like to take some time responding to Lukas’s comment to last week’s post.
        I’ve spent a while debating whether or not to store all file records in the database or
        continue with the current solution with only recording folders and any files that differ
        compared to their parent folder. I’ve decided that it is best to stick with current solution
        because ownCloud isn’t designed nor wants to support a large number of users, but only small
        groups. Lukas also suggested some additional permissions or rules instead of the current
        read or write. Well, protected files are what every user has in their own directory. Private
        files with links are what the public link app can already do using a token for the link.
        Eventually this will be part of sharing files and offer the same functionality in one
        interface. Shared files right now are pulled directly out of the owner’s file system, but
        you have limited power when dealing with those files and can’t physically delete them, only
        unshare the files from yourself. Creating copies of the files would require a huge rewrite
        and it doesn’t seem to be worth the effort. If you’re still confused about how sharing files
        work and where your files are going please continue to ask questions. (...)</para>

      <para>There are arguments for each side, naturally. The biggest for Android being Linux is, of course, the fact that the kernel for the Linux operating system and the Android operating system are very nearly one and the same. Not completely the same, mind you, but Android&apos;s kernel is directly derived from Linux. (...)</para>

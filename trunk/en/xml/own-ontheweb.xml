        <ulink url="http://dot.kde.org/2011/03/03/qt-and-future-kde">KDE News/Cornelius Schumacher: Qt and the Future of KDE</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Following <ulink url="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/02/11/open-letter-from-ceo-stephen-elop-nokia-and-ceo-steve-ballmer-microsoft/">Nokia&apos;s recent announcement</ulink> about its future smart phone development strategy,
        KDE has received a lot of questions. Many of these questions have been related to the future
        of KDE and KDE&apos;s commitment to the Qt framework. In this statement we set out what we see as
        a bright future for Qt and KDE software.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Qt</emphasis></para>
      <para>We chose Qt in 1996 because it offered the best software development framework. Today,
        it still does. Over the last fifteen years, KDE has worked to ensure that Qt will always be
        available, leading to the creation of agreements such as that which underpins the <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php">KDE Free Qt Foundation</ulink>. The future of Qt has been further strengthened in recent years by
        Nokia&apos;s decisions to release it under the LGPL and begin the process of giving the community
        greater influence through Open Governance. We are working with our partners to speed up this
        process and make <ulink url="http://qt-labs.org/index.php/Main_Page">Open Governance</ulink>
        a reality. In the meantime, we welcome Nokia&apos;s ongoing commitment to Qt, as well as their
        continued support of KDE, as <ulink url="http://ev.kde.org/supporting-members.php">a Patron</ulink> and as a sponsor of our annual conference.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE</emphasis></para>
      <para>Today, KDE faces new challenges and opportunities. Traditional desktop and laptop
        computers are no longer the only means for users to work on documents, entertain themselves
        and interact socially. Innovations such as netbooks, tablets and increasingly capable smart
        phones have changed computer use, introducing new form factors and new use cases. For the
        first time since KDE was founded, we have the chance to shape the nature of computer use,
        rather than competing with established computing paradigms.</para>
      <para>Our Plasma framework puts us in a strong position to develop innovative and beautiful
        user interfaces for smart phones, in-vehicle systems, desktop computers, portable computers,
        home media centers and more. Few, if any, of our competitors have an application and user
        interface framework that is as portable, attractive and easy to develop with as ours. At the
        heart of Plasma and the portability of our applications is Qt. Code developed for one
        platform can run with minimal changes on legacy platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Max
        OS X and, crucially, on Linux and other free platforms that can scale from the handheld
        device to the desktop powerhouse. Recent innovations in Qt, such as Qt Quick, make it easier
        than ever for designers as well as developers to turn their ideas into applications and
        offer them to users. KDE is only just beginning to take advantage of these new
        opportunities.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">The Future</emphasis></para>
      <para>Qt remains the strong, cross-platform foundation of everything we do. Combined with KDE
        technologies, we believe Qt is the compelling framework for cross-platform software
        development. There has never been a better time to shape the future of computing. <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/community/getinvolved/">Join us</ulink> and make that future a
        future that is free.</para>

        California at <ulink url="http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/kabuki">Hotel Kabuki</ulink>. Held
        annually in the United States, Camp KDE provides a regional opportunity for KDE contributors

        experiences. The event will feature in-depth talks by core KDE developers. </para>

          >Ostatic/Susan Linton: openSUSE Thinking About Naming Change</ulink></title>
      <para>Andreas Jaeger, Program Manager at Novell for openSUSE, has posted about an on-going
        discussion concerning the naming convention of openSUSE. Apparently the traditional "old
        school" 11.4, 12.0, 12.1, etc. might need some modernization. Developers and active users
        have suggested several alternatives.</para>
      <para>Jaeger <ulink
          url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/11/how-to-name-the-distribution-releases/"
          >explains</ulink> that despite common belief openSUSE doesn't actually employ major and
        minor number versioning. So to assume that 11.4 is an update to 11.3 is incorrect. That
        explains all the times reviewers said things like 'despite being only a minor version
        upgrade, there are enough new and updated features to warrant a major number up-tick.' They
        just usually "count it always until 3." So, next release would be 12.0.</para>

      <para>The first thing you’ll notice when the <ulink url="http://www.opensuse.org/"

        getting it as close to your normal GUI without having to include a mouse. You also get a
        decent amount of boot and language options (e.g. safe boot) but you start off with english
        as the default language (unlike some distros where you have to select a language at the
        booting screen), which might save time for some, but could cause some difficulties for
        non-english speakers. (...)</para>

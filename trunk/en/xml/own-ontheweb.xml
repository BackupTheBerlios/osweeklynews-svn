      <para>LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve the suite’s functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.</para>
      <para>Since, at the moment, there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites. Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community, and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.</para>

      <para>As most PC users know by now, Microsoft has given us a glimpse into what will one day be
        the Windows 8 operating system. Leaving aside the many changes in the new OS – it's a major
        shift from what we've previously seen from Microsoft – there's an extra feature included
        with Windows 8 that has <ulink

      <para>The new feature in question is called Secure Boot. It's designed to act as a security
        tool for PC users. However, there's some concern as to whether this function will be enabled
        without a clear way of disabling it should someone wish to do so.</para>
      <para>In other words, with Secure Boot enabled, you wouldn't be able to install your favorite

      <para>What does the <ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516">Windows 8 Developer Preview</ulink> have to do with the Linux desktop? Not much, you might think at first, especially since the final version is likely to be vastly different than the preview.</para>
      <para>But as I explored the preview, I couldn&apos;t help asking myself: is this the first hint of how major desktops will look in the future on all operating systems? It&apos;s a distinct and -- for a Linux desktop user -- an alarming possibility.</para>

      <para>High context cultures value personal relationships over process. You have to know someone before you can trust them and work with them. They also tend to be less explicit and rely more on tone of voice, gestures and even status to communicate. Typically Asian countries are more high context than Western countries. Think Korea and Japan.</para>
      <para>Low context cultures are process driven. They rely on facts and processes. Their communication style is much more direct and action-orientated. They are orientated towards the individual rather than the group. Western cultures like the US and Germany are considered low context. (...)</para>

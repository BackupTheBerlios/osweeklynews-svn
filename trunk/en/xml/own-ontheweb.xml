      <para>Many people use Linux every day and never know it. Indeed, they’re often using Linux without even knowing they’re using a computing device. For years now, Linux has been the operating system of choice for Digital Video Recorders (DVR)s, DVD players, Smart TVs, Wi-Fi access points, GPS devices, and on and on. But, there’s never been a Linux kernel just for consumer electronics… until now.</para>

      <para>A few years ago, when I was working as a print magazine editor, a young girl approached my booth at LinuxFest Northwest in Bellingham, Washington. She was probably 12- or 13-years old, and she gave me some of the best feedback I&apos;d ever had on our products.</para>

      <para>My new young friend told me what she liked about our articles, the art, and even our ads. She pointed out that one of our ads looked too much like an ad a hosting provider was running, and she was right. She told me that I needed to give out stickers for her and other attendees to put on their laptops, which I immediately ordered after the event. I thanked her for stopping and taking the time to make me look at our magazines from a fresh perspective. (...)</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">1. Introduction</emphasis></para>
      <para>The whole Linux community is based on the concept of community and collaboration. Without it, Linus Torvalds&apos; e-mail sent out 20 years ago would have been forgotten and none of us would have known about Linux. As time went by, it became easier and easier for users, regardless of experience and knowledge, to contribute to his/her favorite distribution. While we&apos;re at it, it&apos;s a common misconception that you have to be a programmer in order to help the Linux community. Well, nothing could be further from the truth.  Anyone can help, provided he or she has Internet access, and, more importantly, the will to help. You are not expected to have any particular knowledge, just to have a few hours/week available for this. This article will not be specific to a distribution or another, because there are hundreds of them and anyway, the general concepts are the same. (...)</para>

      <para>One of the great things about the original Star Wars trilogy, was the “lived in”, junky, hacked together aesthetic of the Star Wars universe. Everything was a bit trashed, as if real people actually lived there. Thankfully, that’s one of the things that George Lucas hasn’t tinkered with in his endless quest to ruin the childhood memories of a generation. So it’s heartening to see this tradition carried on with the playing of the imperial death march on miscellaneous hacked together hardware. Enjoy … (...)</para>

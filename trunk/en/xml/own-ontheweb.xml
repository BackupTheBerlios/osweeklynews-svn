        KDE Plasma Workspaces, KDE Applications, and the KDE Platform that provides the foundation
        for KDE software. Version 4.7 of these releases provide many new features and improved

      <para>The KDE desktop is about to take a major step forward, with the announcement today of
        the roadmap for KDE Frameworks 5.0.</para>
      <para>Most eyes in the Linux desktop world are on the Berlin Desktop Summit this week, as
        members of the GNOME and KDE camps come together for a joint technical conference running
        from August 6-12 at Humboldt University in Berlin. Currently, KDE seems to be making the
        most strides in the joint event, with the surprise announcement of the KDE 5.0 roadmap,
        which was revealed by KDE developer Aaron Seigo in his blog Sunday.</para>
      <para>According to Seigo, the new KDE Frameworks roadmap, which will encompass "the next major
        release of KDE's libraries and runtime requirements," will have an "emphasis... on
        modularity, dependency clarity/simplification and increasing quality to the next level."

      <para>According to commit counts it seems 54 developers from Oracle, everybody&apos;s favorite bad guy these days, has the highest employee count. This was a full 18% of all commits. As Italo Vignoli explained, &quot;Oracle contributions are related to the OOo code that has been merged with LibreOffice, and in fact the number of commits has decreased dramatically during the last few months. There are, though, some former Oracle developers contributing on a volunteer basis to LibreOffice.&quot; (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>With the release of a new version of <ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org/"
          >LibreOffice</ulink> this month, it’s a good time to look at the two major open source
        office suites, LibreOffice and<ulink url="http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/openoffice"
          >OpenOffice.org</ulink>, to see what advantages each offers, and which is a better bet for
        end users.</para>
      <para>Both products are suites of office applications, comprising word process, spreadsheet,
        presentation graphics, database, drawing, and math tools. Both also spring from the same
        code base. OpenOffice.org was created by a German company called Star Division, which Sun
        Microsystems bought in 1999. Originally the suite was called StarOffice, and it was popular
        in the European market as an alternative to Microsoft Office. After picking it up, Sun
        changed the name of the product to OpenOffice.org and released its code as open source. The
        product retained some popularity in the enterprise, partly because of its cross-platform
        capabilities and no-cost license.</para>
      <para>In 2009, Oracle announced it would be acquiring Sun, and many wondered what would become
        of OpenOffice.org. When Oracle proved to be less than willing to share its plans for the
        product, a number of<ulink
          url="http://listarchives.documentfoundation.org/www/announce/msg00000.html">OpenOffice.org
          community members opted to fork the OpenOffice.org code</ulink>. In November 2010, they
        created LibreOffice, to be managed by a new German non-profit called <ulink

      <para>A few months later, <ulink url="http://lwn.net/Articles/446093/">Oracle opted to donate
          the OpenOffice.org project to the Apache Software Foundation</ulink>, which today

        migration process to become fully integrated within the Apache organization. (...)</para>

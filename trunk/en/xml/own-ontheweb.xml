        20 different countries, we<ulink

        fever, learned to sail, and I got a pilot’s license. We’re lucky people, and it’s been
        pretty great. What could ever pull me away from this grand adventure?</para>
      <para>A brand new adventure.</para>
      <para>I’m excited to report that I’m joining <ulink url="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</ulink>
        as co-founder and CEO this week. I’m honored to be joining Miguel, Joseph and an all-star
        engineering team. And I am very passionate about our mission: to make mobile software
        development incredibly fast and easy.</para>
      <para>In the last year, one thing that I’ve learned is that mobile phones are, for many
        people, their first direct contact with software. We met people in the most remote areas of
        the world, living in straw huts without electricity or running water, who have mobile
        phones. And so anything we do that improves mobile software improves the lives of billions
        of people. I’m passionate about this, and I’m very excited about the chance we have at
        Xamarin.</para>
      <para>We believe that mobile development is in its first stages and that we can deliver an
        incredible mobile development experience — far better than what exists today. Our objective
        is to build great products that people love. We want to pamper our customers.</para>
      <para>I’m about to board a plane to Boston this morning where we’ll get things kicked off,
        before moving to San Francisco later in the year. There’s a lot to be done. I’ll try to keep
        you posted!</para>

      </title>
      <para>Just giving updates of my GSoC project (Plasma Media Center) that I have done yet.
        Initially, I read the QML docmentation which is required to write GUI of MediaCenter. In
        between I tried to understand the existing architecture of MediaCenter and I had the IRC
        meeting with with my mentor (Marco Martin together with others). After discussion we came to
        conclusion that what initially we should do to start with.</para>
      <para>According to suggetsion, first I have written a simple QML plasmoid which improved my
        understanding in QML. First Plasmoid I have written is mediacontroller which will control
        (play/pause,etc) the playing music and videos. Currently, my created plasmoid has different
        control buttons with no any interaction. Snapshot of plasmoid</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
      <para>Second, I have written a DataEngine name org.kde.mediacentercontrol using C++
        (consisting of fake data as of now) with keys: state (playing), position, MediaType, Url.
        Snapshot of DataEngin</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
      <para>Next step will be to write associated services so that read and write operation can be
        done on data. After completion, will move to write other plasmoids which is required for
        MediaCenter. Will keep updating after completion of certain part of my work. Keep reading my
        blog and finally will get a working MediaCenter for KDE <inlinemediaobject>

      </title>
      <para>While many people use Skype for its free voice over IP (VoIP) services, Linux users have
        a love/hate relationship with it. Yes, Skype will run on some versions of Linux, but it
        doesn&apos;t run on all of them, and the Linux version (2.2-beta) lags far behind the Windows
        version (Skype 5.3). That&apos;s three major generations behind. Need I say more?</para>
      <para>Much as I dislike <ulink url="http://www.itworld.com/networking/163569/microsoft-agrees-buy-skype-85-billion">Microsoft&apos;s recent purchase of Skype</ulink> and even though I think <ulink url="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/how-skype-does-and-doesn-8217t-work/1051">Skype&apos;s technology</ulink> is held together by bailing wire and duct tape, maybe Skype
        will become better for Linux with Microsoft. After all, it couldn&apos;t be much worse!</para>
      <para>That said, there are numerous Linux VoIP programs and they&apos;re also free as in
        &quot;free beer,&quot; as well as free as in &quot;free software.&quot; Most of these
        programs use the open SIP (<ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">Session Initiation Protocol</ulink>) standard or Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
          (<ulink url="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</ulink>) If they use the same protocol, you should be
        able to use one client to call another. To do this, of course, they must be on the same SIP
        or XMPP network. For example, I use the Ekiga.net VoIP network for SIP calls. </para>

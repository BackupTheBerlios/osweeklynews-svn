      <para>Open source activists Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner announce the launch today of the
        Ada Initiative (http://adainitiative.org/), a non-profit organization to promote
        women&apos;s participation in open technology and culture. </para>
      <para>Open technology and culture, including open source software, open content, and related
        communities, suffer from a dearth of women at all levels. &quot;Open technology and culture
        are shaping our future and must reflect all people. Involving more women in the creation of
        our future is a critical step in building a healthy Internet world,&quot; says Mitchell
        Baker, chair of the Mozilla Foundation. The Ada Initiative will concentrate on focused,
        direct action programs, including recruitment and training for women, education for
        community members, and working with companies and projects to improve their outreach to
        women. (...)</para>

        automatically integrated (although birthdays without the year display the wrong age at the

      <para>Please contact me in case you have any problems or feedback. Bugs are best reported on the <ulink url="http://bugs.kde.org/">KDE bugtracker</ulink>, there is a

      <para>For version 0.1, I plan to move the repository to <ulink url="http://projects.kde.org/">projects.kde.org</ulink> and add support for translations. More importantly, 
      0.1 will be the first real release, which will hopefully be picked up by packagers, so stay tuned!</para>
      <para>Oh, and since we’re talking about Facebook, there is also a page for the Akonadi resource <ulink

      <para>Writing the resource was easy and lots of fun, and hopefully many of you will find it useful. I am certainly looking forward adding more cool features to it.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Update</emphasis>: The Facebook resource should now compile against KDE SC 4.6.0. Please comment or file a bug report if you still have a 
      problem compiling.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Update</emphasis>: Some people report having trouble authenticating with Facebook, sometimes the links in the embedded web view don’t seem to 
        work. I would appreciate help from a KDE webkit developer here. To workaround that problem, first log in to Facebook with Konqueror. You may also need to grab the 
        authentication URL from the debug output of the resource and view that URL in Konqueror, you should see something like “<emphasis 
          role="italic">https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?…</emphasis>” in the debug output.</para>

        Ubuntu 11.04. To quickly summarize the situation, Banshee will be the new default music
        player in Ubuntu. Let me say up front, as a disclaimer: Banshee is to a large extent being
        developed by my employer, Novell. Banshee has support for the Amazon music store and
        includes a referral code in there, as you’d expect. The benefits of this amount to around
        $10,000 per year right now, which goes to the GNOME Foundation. Sadly, Canonical recently
        visited the Banshee mailing list and told them the Amazon store had to go. It could stay,
        they said, but only if Banshee gave 75% of the earnings to Canonical instead of GNOME. The
        Banshee developers graciously declined. Now Banshee (in Ubuntu at least) will have Ubuntu
        One as default music store and users will have to enable Amazon by themselves.

        </note>&quot;For some time now, I have been meaning to write a series of blog posts setting
        forth my views on best practices in forming and governing open source foundations. Why?
        Because despite the increasing reliance of just about every part of our modern world
        (government, finance, defense, and so on) on open source software (OSS) and Free and Open
        Source Software (FOSS), there has been very little written on the subject. </para>
      <para>That means that neither a community nor a corporation has much to refer to in creating
        the kind of governance structure most likely to ensure that the intentions of the founders
        are carried out, that the rights of contributors are respected, and that the code upon which
        end users will rely is properly maintained into the future. (...)&quot;</para>

        carefully staged Microsoft PR events designed purposely to embarrass Linux on the desktop. I

        &quot;FUD!&quot; and &quot;Hokum!&quot; would sail out from my keyboard. </para>
      <para>Training people to use Linux, I would reason, is no harder than training them to use
        Windows or OS X. Any statements to the contrary, I would further argue, were merely playing

      <para>June 25th, 2011. Today, KDE has released a release candidate of the upcoming 4.7 release
        of the Plasma Desktop and Netbook workspaces, the KDE Applications and the KDE Frameworks,
        which is planned for July 27, 2011. With API, dependency and feature freezes in place, the
        KDE team&apos;s focus is now on fixing last-minute showstopper bugs and finishing translation and
        documentation that comes along with the releases. (...)</para>

      <para>Do you ever wish your kids would do something besides play video games on the computer? What if you could get a head start teaching them to be the next generation of open source developers?</para>
      <para>Computers are increasingly easy to use, but programming is far more complex--and less accessible. For many of us who now have small children, programming began with BASIC programs on computers that forced you to make them do something by offering nothing but a command line.</para>
      <para>At school, kids often learn how to use tools but not how to create. Tools become obsolete quickly, so knowing how to create is much more important, and the tools will be successively intuitive. (...)</para>

      <para>This week yet another major global IT vendor will launch a product based on Linux - the HP Touchpad, which looks quite promising from early reviews. Even so, it is ironic that I still hear the following comment from a number of investors and business people:</para>
      <para>“Open source is great, but you can’t make any money with it.”</para>
      <para>While for some reason this sentiment has existed as long as open source software has been in existence, the facts don’t support it; in fact, the facts expose it to be a statement hovering between unbelievable and ridiculous. Red Hat will exceed $1 Billion dollars in revenue this year. Its investors have been richly rewarded over the past decade with more than an 8X return over the S&amp;P 500. (...)</para>

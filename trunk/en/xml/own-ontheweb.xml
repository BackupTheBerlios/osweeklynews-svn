          Invention Network</ulink></title>
      <para>The Document Foundation has joined the Open Invention Network (OIN), to further extend
        the free software ecosystems. By becoming a licensee, The Document Foundation - developer of
        LibreOffice, a free office suite for personal and corporate productivity - has joined the
        growing list of organizations that recognize the importance of participating in the Open
        Invention Network, in order to protect the free software ecosystem from the risks associated
        to software patents.</para>
      <para><quote>The Document Foundation is a major free software project, and LibreOffice a key
          office suite for creating, managing and sharing documents. By becoming a licensee of the
          Open Invention Network, we fight software patents - which stifle innovation and encourage
          predatory business practices - and at the same time we improve the protection of our
          software projects,</quote> said Charles Schulz, Member of TDF Steering Committee.</para>
      <para>Patents owned by Open Invention Network are available royalty-free to whichever company,
        institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against free software.
        Through this network of developers, distributors, sellers, resellers and end-users that
        license its patent portfolio, Open Invention Network is creating a supportive and shielded
        ecosystem to ensure the growth and adoption of free and open source software. This enables
        OIN licensees like The Document Foundation to make significant investments, helping to fuel
        economic growth. </para>
      <para>OIN has amassed a broad portfolio of patents, including patents held by nominees on its
        behalf. These patents are available to all licensees as part of the patent portfolio that
        OIN is creating in support of free software. The license agreement is at <ulink

          >http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/pat_license_agreement.php</ulink></para>
      <para>The home of The Document Foundation is at <ulink url="http://www.documentfoundation.org"
          >http://www.documentfoundation.org.</ulink></para>
      <para>The Document Foundation has the mission to facilitate the evolution of the OOo Community
        into a new open, independent, and meritocratic organization within the next few months. An
        independent Foundation is a better match to the values of contributors, users and
        supporters, and will enable a more effective, efficient, transparent, and inclusive
        Community. TDF will protect past investments by building on the achievements of the first
        decade, will encourage wide participation in the Community, and will co-ordinate activity
        across the Community.</para>

          >pleased to announce</ulink> that we have joined the Open Invention Network community as a
        licensee. </para>
      <para>Open Invention Network was founded as a way to help defend the Linux ecosystem, and by
        extension much of the Free and Open Source software world, from the risks associated with
        software patents. Patents owned by Open Invention Network are available royalty-free to any
        company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against the Linux
        System, creating an umbrella of protection for its members.</para>
      <para><quote>We view an OIN license as one of the key methods through which open source
          innovators can deter patent aggression,” said Adriaan de Groot, vice president of KDE. “We
          are committed to freedom of action in Linux, and in taking a license we help to address
          the threat from companies that support proprietary platforms to the exclusion of open
          source initiatives, and whose behaviors reflect a disdain for inventiveness and
          collaboration.</quote></para>
      <para><quote>Given its leadership in creating a user-friendly computing experience, including
          its advanced graphical desktop for the Linux community, we are pleased to have KDE become
          a licensee,” said Keith Bergelt, CEO of Open Invention Network. “By doing so, KDE affirms
          its continued support for open source. We applaud their foresight in taking this step to
          support both itself and the open source community broadly.</quote></para>
      <para>While KDE maintains our position against software patents, this development provides an
        additional safety net for KDE when it comes to the risks Free Software is facing from such
        patents today.</para>

          >21 More Notable Free Linux Games (Part 2 of 3)</ulink></title>
      <para>We have always been strong advocates of computer games. Rather than rotting the brain,
        computer games are interactive, teach essential life skills, and can stimulate learning.
        They also have been proven to enhance skills such as creativity, cooperation, teamplay, as
        well as encouraging innovative and strategic thinking and improving hand-eye coordination. </para>
      <para>Linux is not championed as a viable gaming platform in many communities, in part because
        of its smaller user base and the relatively low number of commercially supported native
        Linux games that are released each year. However, there are a number of encouraging
        developments on this front. For example, the Unigine engine should enable developers to
        produce high-quality 3D games with up-to-date visuals and advanced rendering. One title to
        be released using this engine is OilRush. This eagerly awaited title fuses a classical real
        time strategy with a Tower Wars genre. </para>
      <para>Notwithstanding these developments, Linux has an ever-expanding library of tens of
        thousands of free games, many of which are released under an open source license. A good
        proportion of these titles are entertaining, highly addictive, offer captivating gameplay,
        and are challenging. (...)</para>

          >Ostatic/Susan Linton: My Top Five Favorite Distributions for 2010</ulink></title>
      <para>Ms. Carla Schroder shared a list of her <quote>bestest distros</quote> recently, so I
        thought I might follow suit. She called hers <quote>not-usual</quote> and looking at her
        list, I'd say my choices are probably a little more usual. In any case, here are my top five
        favorite Linux distributions for 2010, in no real order.</para>
      <para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><ulink url="http://www.mepis.org/">MEPIS</ulink></para>
            <para>SimplyMEPIS has always been one of my favorite distributions for several reasons.
              SimplyMEPIS was one of the first to understand that looks do matter and so does out of
              the box functionality. It includes proprietary drivers, codecs, and browser plugins
              that make using Linux enjoyable. It leans toward the conservative side concerning new
              version of its components, but that makes for an extremely stable operating system. In
              all its years I only ran into one release that gave me any trouble, and that was about
              three or four years ago - possibly when it went through its Ubuntu phase. It is truly
              one of the best.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><ulink url="http://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</ulink></para>
            <para>openSUSE has been one of my favorites since it first opened up to community
              involvement in 2005. Novell's agreement with Microsoft did damper my enthusiasm a bit,
              but the distro itself remains one of the most polished and professional offerings we
              have. It just has a commercial feel to it. Like SimplyMEPIS, I only encountered one
              release that gave me any trouble. Otherwise, its been a slick and attractive distro. I
              don't run it full time mainly because I'd have to hunt up some one-clicks (that are
              available for openSUSE) or install codecs and stuff myself to get going and then worry
              about those updates. But it always remains high on my radar. I follow its development
              very closely. I'm a little worried about what will become of it despite assurances.
              But as long as it lives, so will my admiration. (...)</para>

      <para>The X.org developers have released version X11R7.6 of their graphics system, which
        contains the X Server version 1.9.3. One of the innovations in 7.6 is that it uses udev for

      <para>Xorg configuration directories now allow the X Server configuration to be saved as
        individual module files. For instance, the input device driver matching rules previously

      <para><emphasis role="bold">What is Project Bretzn?</emphasis></para>
      <para>Apart from being a tasty Bavarian bread-snack, Bretzn is a code-name for a collection of
        technology aimed at solving a problem which has existed in software development for a very
        long time: How do you get your applications build for all available platforms and get it to
        your users?</para>
      <para>In the open source community, we already have many individual bits of this dream in
        place. We the great cross platform toolkit Qt, we have the powerful openSuse Build Service
        which allows for the easy creation of binaries for a great number of Linux distributions, we
        have the Open Collaboration Services (OCS) which allows for the easy and socially adept
        distribution of packages both to and from central software download sites such as
        KDE-Apps.org, and we have a great many powerful integrated development enviromnents such as
        Qt Creator, KDevelop and Eclipse.</para>
      <para>In the spring of 2010 these many powerful and successful technologies and tools made up
        mostly isolated islands, and it seemed the obvious choice to begin the process of bridging
        them. Finally, in August the same year, the project was begun and and announced during the
        openSUSE conference in October. Project Bretzn would make it possible, with a few clicks, to
        publish software projects directly from the IDE. The development of this project is
        sponsored by Nokia. (...)</para>

      <para>The Indian KDE community will organize its first conference at Bengaluru in March 2011.
        The 5 day event will bring together KDE contributors, Qt developers, users and FOSS

      <para>We realise that there are not many KDE/Qt related events that are accessible to Indians.
        FOSS conferences or meetings are an excellent way to show people the technology first hand
        and ways to contribute to it. We not only dazzle them with the world of KDE, but show them
        first hand how simple it is to get involved and make a difference. This is our motivation
        for conducting this event. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>Welcome to the Qtest Mobile App Port! As developers of applications using Qt, you
        already know how great it is to work with - but how about on mobile platforms, such as
        Symbian and MeeGo? How would you like to take that step you have been wanting to take, but
        not been able to justify: Take your application from the desktop and bring it into the
        hand-held world via the Ovi store. Let this contest be the justification, with the
        possibility of a new phone or even 10,000 euros waiting at the end. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Dates</emphasis>: The contest starts on 20th of December, 2010,
        and runs till 28th of February. The 31st of December is important for you if you wish to
        take part in the Early Bird competition. If you do no win, you will still take part in the
        main competition, and will be allowed to continue your work and submit new versions to the
        Ovi Store. The 28th of February is the deadline for taking part in the main
        competition.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Developer Sprint</emphasis>: There will be a sponsored developer
        sprint organized together with the KDE e.V. during the competition. The travel and stay can
        be paid for if you do not have the budget yourself. Further details will be made public at a
        later time, and all participants will be notified of this information via email. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Judging and prizes</emphasis>: The Qtest Mobile App Port is
        evaluated by a panel of judges which will be announced in the next few days. The jury will
        pic 5 winners at 31th of December as the early bird winners. Every winner gets a free N900
        phone. The main competition first prize is EUR 10,000, which will be awarded to the
        application which the judges find to be the best ported application. The second to sixth
        price will be another 5 N900 phones.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Eligibility</emphasis>: To be able to take part in the contest,
        the ported application must be submitted for Ovi Store signing by one of the two deadlines:
        - Early bird entries must be submitted by December 31st - Standard entries must be submitted
        by February 28th.</para>
      <para>You also have to submit your application to the &quot;Mobile Contest&quot; category on
        Qt-Apps.org or MeeGo-Central.org </para>
      <para>You can submit your application to the Ovi Store as many times as you wish during the
        competition. This allows you to get feedback from the public on your software. It´s possible
        to submit new or existing KDE/Qt applications.</para>
      <para>So have fun and good luck everybody!</para>

      </title>
      <para>I&apos;ve been thinking and thinking about everything, and I&apos;ve figured out what I
        need to explain to you next. Reading <ulink url="http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-project/2010/opensuse-project.2010-12-15-19.01.log.html">the log</ulink> of the recent OpenSUSE board meeting discussing setting up a foundation
        for the project turned on the light in my head: you need to understand bylaws. Because
        corporations are setting up foundations to get you to donate code to them, and they set them
        up to suit themselves, not to benefit you. There&apos;s a difference between the community
        setting up a foundation to be a project&apos;s home and a corporate sponsor doing it.
        I&apos;m going to write about that in more detail later. To really explain it, I need to
        explain some things that you might think will be boring or too foreign, but if you can learn
        Perl, you can learn bylaws.</para>
      <para>I&apos;ll tell you that my favorite task when I was working as a paralegal was drawing
        up bylaws for new businesses and entities setting up for the first time. It interests me, so
        I&apos;ll try to make it interesting to you. But what should motivate you is this: whatever
        the bylaws say is what the entity legally can and can&apos;t do. It matters. It will affect
        you. So, just as you&apos;d try to learn a language before visiting a foreign country, at
        least enough to get around so that if you get lost, you&apos;ll have some way to find your
        hotel again and a bathroom en route, you should understand enough about bylaws and
        incorporation so no one can blindside you.</para>
      <para>I&apos;m still working on the Comes v. Microsoft exhibits project, and I swore I&apos;d
        finish first, so it will take me a while to get to this to explain in detail, but in the
        meantime, I just want to say to the community stakeholders in the OpenSUSE Project,
        here&apos;s what I think you should do:</para>
      <tip>
        <para>Hire your own lawyer. Don&apos;t rely on Novell&apos;s lawyers to represent the
          community&apos;s interests in the foundation. (...)</para>

      <para>Using free software in education is not just about saving money. It&apos;s also about
        preserving choice, not locking a student&apos;s experience into a certain way of doing
          something.<xref linkend="fig.edu"/></para>
      <para>With Linux, there&apos;s no vendor lock-in. Free software is more likely to be
        open-standards compliant, and it&apos;s going to be more open to different languages,
        localities and curricula.</para>
      <para>It also removes what can sometimes be a barrier to learning; using the same software on
        your own machine at home. And because there&apos;s usually more than one piece of open
        source software for a job, free software makes it easier to broaden your experience and look
        at a variety of methods for completing that job.</para>
      <para>All of which is essential in a world where technology is turned on its head every five
        years and where training needs are so unpredictable. It&apos;s also never too early to start
        training in IT skills, and in the UK at least, computer training starts for many at primary
        school level.</para>
      <para>For some, this will be their first experience of a computer. It&apos;s also likely to be
        the first time they&apos;ve had any kind of formal training on how to use one, and these
        first impressions are going to last. So there&apos;s a strong argument that teaching should
        be as unbiased as possible.</para>
      <para>Yet for a variety of reasons most schools favour Microsoft. There&apos;s nothing wrong
        with this, as experience with Microsoft&apos;s ubiquitous products is never going to be
        wasted, but as Linux users, we all know there might be a better option.</para>
      <para>Linux and open source offers a genuine alternative, with many advantages over
        proprietary training that aren&apos;t costrelated, although there&apos;s no reason why this
        can&apos;t be part of the overall solution. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>There are often reports regarding concerns about computer games having negative effects
        on children and adults, with the fear that these games can lead to violent behaviour and
        addiction. However, studies by leading researchers have shown that there are many positive
        attributes to playing computer games, some of which we have alluded to in our earlier
        articles. Computer games can help players to improve their cognitive skills, enhance
        creativity, deepen language and maths skills, and help people to think on their feet and
        outside the box, the latter referring to novel, creative and smart thinking. However, above
        all these things, games offer pure, unadulterated fun. </para>
      <para>Linux is vastly underrated as a gaming platform. This may be due to the fact that there
        is no significant marketing of Linux games. With a lack of big-name games featuring in the
        computing press, coupled with a low market share for Linux on desktop PCs, things might seem
        bleak, with major barriers to the growth of Linux games.</para>
      <para>However, the reality is that Linux has a huge range of games (predominately free to
        download). Whilst they do not gain much publicity, many of them offer real depth and
        gameplay. The purpose of this three part article is to help draw attention to these unsung
        gems. (...)</para>

        And since I write fiction as well as technology pieces, it’s in my best interest to know how

        a serious swing away from the traditional routes. With the major improvements in e-readers,
        more and more users are migrating away from the old standard hardcover/paperback books to
        digital formats. This has been a boon for new writers. With the ability to easily
        self-publish for various e-readers, it no longer requires an agent or a publisher to see
        your brilliance. </para>
      <para>But does that mean everyone should be submitting their books? Well, if everyone can

        it is important to have the right tools and/or procedures for getting your books into the
        Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble’s, and Apple systems. Linux can help you do that. Let’s take a

          VP8</ulink></title>
      <para>"Google after a lot of deliberation decided to offer a single standard for web media
        format converting its newly acquired VP8 as a royalty-free licensing policy. This will
        ensure that there is a free and open standard for HTML 5 Web Video. However, the licensing
        handler for VP8 Video codec H.264, MPEG LA, is pulling the plugs on converting it into a
        no-revenue generator. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Why MPEG LA does not want VP8 in open source format?
        </emphasis></para>
      <para>Larry Horn, the MPEG LA chief <ulink url="http://www.mpegla.com/main/pages/media.aspx"
          >believes a patent-pool license for VP8 and WebM</ulink> as the organization wants to
        create a VP8 licensing system. The call is for patent holders on VP8 and WebM to submit
        patents applicable to Googles codec. However, they do admit that it is the patent holder to
        decide if VP8 needs to be licensed. He has reiterated that it is open to all players with
        VP8, Google included. </para>
      <para>The organization is very clear that MPEG LA merely facilitates the creation of pool
        licensing to lower cases of infringement actions amongst users. If WebM and UP8 can come
        under essential patents then the patent owners will benefit and the rush to courts will be
        minimized. However, it is up to the Patent owners to decide if they want to impose the
        patents. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Googles’ call on the looming patent pool </emphasis></para>
      <para>Google apparently anticipated that the specter of licensing would be raised by MPEG LA
        is committed to allowing WebM Project a open source standard without any patent claims for
        all who use the WebM licensed. </para>
      <para>Google every since acquiring the VP8 codec ealier last year was expected to open source
        the VP8 codec after it purchased the video compression company On2 Technologies. However the
        product has a H.264 patent. Google did the expected when it formalized the WebM and put out
        the VP8 as the web standard for web videos so that the hassles of licensing fee can be done
        away completely. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Quick supporters </emphasis></para>
      <para>Google found quick takers for this freebie and Mozilla and Opera quickly offered it on
        FireFox and Opera. Though the codec was offered to support the nascent HTML 5 Video on
        Chrome, firefox and Opera, Google quickly dropped the H.264for fast-tracking the migration
        to WebM. </para>
      <para>Presently Google runs the <ulink url="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/">Adobe
          Flash</ulink> on the <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/">You Tube</ulink> with the
        licensed H.264. However, it offers the HTML 5 and is presently offering as new video on the
        WebM. Therefore, Google needs both capabilities for its browsers – the WebM as well as the
        HTML 5 especially for its YouTube. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Advantage Microsoft and Apple </emphasis></para>
      <para>The two giants have no such constraints since they have both run H.264 and are already a
        part of the patent pool. As a matter of fact, Apple and later Microsoft are playing safe
        with patents and licensing issues on WebM as they believe the original open source on which
        WebM is created, the Ogga Theora is very hazy about the IP issues and would therefore be a
        part of the WebM legacy. </para>

        on will win the final war- Open Source or the licensing hats" (...)</para>

          inclusive Community. We will protect past investments by building on the solid

      <para>This split from Oracle was in a sense a revolution. OpenOffice.org used to be sponsored
        by Sun Micro systems. After Sun was bought out by Oracle there were rumors and fears that
        OpenOffice.org would go the way of OpenSolaris which lost support from Oracle. The Document

      <para>Otellini said "The carriers still want a third ecosystem and the carriers want an open
        ecosystem", according to a Reuters report. Otellini characterised Nokia's decision as a
        financial one, noting he wouldn't have made the same decision that Nokia's CEO, Stephen Elop
        made. "I would probably have gone with Android if I were him", said Otellini, adding, "MeeGo
        would have been the best strategy but he [Elop] concluded he couldn't afford it.""

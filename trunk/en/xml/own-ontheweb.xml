      <para>REDWOOD SHORES, CA--(Marketwire - Jun 1, 2011) - &quot;With today&apos;s proposal to contribute the OpenOffice.org code to The Apache Software Foundation&apos;s Incubator, Oracle continues to demonstrate its commitment to the developer and open source communities. Donating OpenOffice.org to Apache gives this popular consumer software a mature, open, and well established infrastructure to continue well into the future. The Apache Software Foundation&apos;s model makes it possible for commercial and individual volunteer contributors to collaborate on open source product development.&quot; -- Luke Kowalski, vice president, Oracle Corporate Architecture Group.

      <para>(<emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis>: This post is about Plasma Active, a community
        collaboration to bring KDE software to consumer devices. To learn more about Plasma Active,
          <ulink url="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/04/active-routes.html">read this blog post</ulink>.) </para>
      <para>We&apos;ve been a bit quiet lately around the Plasma Active farm. This is mostly due to us
        being rather busy, both with technical as well as organizational tasks. On the technology
        front, things continue to plow forward at a very brisk pace with <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active/Contour">Contour</ulink> shaping up with every
        passing day and libplasma2 (a big part of the Plasma Quick track) zipping ahead nicely. </para>
      <para>Organizationally, we&apos;re learning new lessons every day as to how to best coordinate
        efforts between companies currently involved and reaching out to ones that should be
        involved. <ulink url="http://www.basyskom.com/">Basyskom</ulink> sent a bunch of people to
        the recent MeeGo conf, and the response was fantastic, including some <ulink url="http://www.ubergizmo.com/2011/05/basyskom-shows-off-new-meego-ui-design/">bloggers</ulink><ulink url="http://www.netbooknews.com/26445/basyskom-demos-meego-user-interface-contour-peregrine/">writing</ulink> about the demo that was on offer.</para>
      <para>There&apos;s also been some learning-as-we-grow happening that has hampered outbound
        communication somewhat. For some of the people involved, this is their very first open
        source experience. For others, this is their first foray into the interesting world of
        devices. While it is terrific to expand our merry band of freedom makers, it also has meant
        some learning curves.</para>
      <para>Amongst all that, code is getting written, the user experience design continues to
        mature and new operating system images are being spun. All is good in the land of technical
        progress. Marco is hanging out at my place for a couple days prior to the upcoming Platform
        11 meeting (which starts Wednesday) and we&apos;re getting some work done at a nice pace. </para>
      <para>Today we&apos;re working on Share-Like-Connect and building integration points in Contour for
        it.I am, however, behind on posting news about new Active Apps as well, which I&apos;m going to
        remedy in a moment.</para>

      <para>What is an Active App? It&apos;s a project built with Qt and/or KDE libraries that fits into
        the spirit and use cases of Plasma Active. That means it needs to be touch friendly,
        preferably present the user interface with QtQuick, have a nice separation between data and
        visualization where appropriate and integrate well with the platform.</para>
      <para>In the Plasma Active meta-project, which includes things like Contour and live OS
        images, we&apos;re building up a small army of such apps in the hopes that those projects can
        learn from each other and us from them. It will also help ensure that when someone goes to
        use a Plasma Active device, they don&apos;t just have the Contour user experience but also a host
        of useful stand-alone applications as well.</para>
      <para>I announced our first Active App a couple weeks back: <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Calligra">Calligra</ulink>. Today, we add another to the
        books: <ulink url="http://edu.kde.org/marble/">Marble</ulink>!Marble has already had a
        mobile version for some time, and since mapping is very important functionality for devices
        you carry around with you it was only natural for Plasma Active to meet Marble.</para>
      <para>There is a project going on right now to provide a QtQuick interface to Marble, and we
        will be including this effort in the live images as it matures.</para>

        is reverse engineering the VoIP service Skype &quot;to make skype open source&quot;. Skype&apos;s
        proprietary protocols have allowed the company to maintain control over its peer-to-peer
        voice and video communications network and have been the subject of various types of
        research over the years.</para>
      <para>Bushmanov is not taking a clean room approach, where a researcher examines the network

        anti-debugging measures. Bushmanov may also be taking a risk by redistributing these

        does, but they are still Skype&apos;s intellectual property.</para>

      </title>
      <para>Identi.ca has been buzzing with â€˜project Harmonyâ€™ discussions lately. Harmony aims to be the â€˜Creative Commonsâ€™ of Copyright Assignment Agreements (CAAs). A CAA is basically a contract you sign where you give away ownership of your code, and some free software projects already allow or even demand this for contributions. The Free Software Foundation itself, for example, requires a CAA.</para>
      <para>Essentially, they want to own the code so they can sue anyone who doesnâ€™t abide by the GPL licence (and upgrade to newer versions of the GPL). Other projects have non-mandatory CAAs for similar reasons. Iâ€™m not convinced you really need a CAA, however. Several projects including Linux itself have sued copyright violators successfully without it and you can have a â€˜GPLv3+â€™ licence if you want to move to a newer GPL in the future. But in case of a charitable institution, I guess it probably doesnâ€™t hurt.

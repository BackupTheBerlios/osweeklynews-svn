      <para>Samba 3.6 includes the first Free Software implementation of Microsoft&apos;s new SMB2 file serving protocol. SMB2 within Samba is implemented with a brand new asynchronous server architecture, allowing Samba to display the performance enhancements SMB2 brings to Microsoft networking technology.</para>
      <para>Samba&apos;s new SMB2 server has been tested by major vendors and has been able to double the performance of some network applications when run in conjunction with Microsoft Windows 7® clients. (...)</para>

      <para>We are pleased to announce the Desktop Summit social events, bringing even more excitement and fun to the Conference program. The social events vary from sports to parties, and will take place throughout the week in different locations in Berlin.

      </title>
      <para>The KDE desktop is about to take a major step forward, with the announcement today of
        the roadmap for KDE Frameworks 5.0.</para>
      <para>Most eyes in the Linux desktop world are on the Berlin Desktop Summit this week, as
        members of the GNOME and KDE camps come together for a joint technical conference running
        from August 6-12 at Humboldt University in Berlin. Currently, KDE seems to be making the
        most strides in the joint event, with the surprise announcement of the KDE 5.0 roadmap,
        which was revealed by KDE developer Aaron Seigo in his blog Sunday.</para>
      <para>According to Seigo, the new KDE Frameworks roadmap, which will encompass &quot;the next major
        release of KDE&apos;s libraries and runtime requirements,&quot; will have an &quot;emphasis... on
        modularity, dependency clarity/simplification and increasing quality to the next level.&quot;

      <para>In case you’ve been under a rock for the last decade, you might not know that today’s technology wars aren’t over who has the best prices, the most features, or the greatest quality. No, in 2011, instead of working on innovating, tech. giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, are now wasting their resources on intellectual property (IP) lawsuits. So, perhaps it should come as no surprise that networking powerhouse <ulink url="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</ulink> and social networking force <ulink url="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</ulink>, is joining the Linux patent protection group, the <ulink url="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">Open Invention Network (OIN)</ulink>.

      </title>
      <para>The Linux kernel development process may be getting a little tweaking if a proposal by -stable kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman is accepted; tweaking needed to meet growing commercial interest in Linux.</para>
      <para>The proposal is simple, on the surface and all the way down: Currently, the 2.6.32 kernel is maintained as a -longterm kernel, a kernel release that is maintained as a stable release with bug fixes and patches for a relatively lengthy period of time. This is opposed to the official -stable release of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel release most suitable for general use, and is dropped when the next release is moved into the -stable category. (The current -stable release, for example, is the 3.0.1 kernel.) (...)</para>

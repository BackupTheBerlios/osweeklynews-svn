          Karlitscheck: Contest deadline extended</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Several developers approached me and asked for more time to port their applications. So
        we extend the deadline of the contest to 31. of march. Everybody has one more month to port
        a KDE or Qt application to Symbian or MeeGo. Remember that you can win 10.000,- so please
        consider to make your KDE or Qt application ready for mobile. </para>
      <para>You find more informatiuon in the original contest announcement: <ulink

      </para>
      <para>Please make sure that you also provide binaries for you applications. This makes is a
        lot easier for the jury to test you application. Have fun and good luck.</para>

      <title><ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-net-attack/">Sourceforge:
          Sourceforge.net attack</ulink></title>
      <para>Yesterday our vigilant operations guys detected a targeted attack against some of our
        developer infrastructure. The attack resulted in an exploit of several SourceForge.net
        servers, and we have proactively shut down a handful of developer centric services to
        safeguard data and protect the majority of our services. </para>
      <para>Our immediate priorities are to prevent further exposure and ensure data integrity.
        We’ve had all hands on deck working on identifying the exploit vector or vectors,
        eliminating them, and are now focusing on verifying data integrity and restoring the
        impacted services. </para>
      <para>The problem was initially discovered on the servers that host CVS but our analysis
        indicates that several other machines were involved, and while we believe we’ve determined
        the extent of the attack, we are verifying all of our other services and data. </para>
      <para>As a short term response, we’ve taken down the following services to prevent any
        possible escalation:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>CVS Hosting</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>Once the immediate response to this attack is over, we will be providing a much more
        detailed account of what’s happened, and what specific actions we are taking to prevent
        further exploits.</para>

        <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tw2JOuct7k">Linux User &amp; Developer/Jos Poortvliet:The openSUSE column #96 with Jos Poortvliet</ulink>
      </title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">openSUSE community manager, Jos Poortvliet, talks about the latest in openSUSE projects and developments since the successful openSUSE Conference last October… </emphasis></para>
      <para>Since the openSUSE Conference in Nuremberg in October, the openSUSE community has been
        extremely active. New projects announced there have progressed, and others have emerged. One
        example of the latter would be the announcement of Project Tumbleweed by kernel hacker and
        openSUSE contributor Greg Kroah-Hartman. The goal of this project is to create a
        ‘rolling-release’ version of openSUSE. A rolling-release distribution (like Arch Linux or
        Gentoo) always offers the latest stable versions of a package in updates so that when a new
        release surfaces, users actually don’t have to do an upgrade! </para>
      <para>Tumbleweed is something you could probably only pull off in openSUSE. While openSUSE is
        a fixed-schedule release project (with a release every 8th), we provide newer stable
        packages for a variety of things on the openSUSE Build Service (OBS). OBS warrants an
        article on its own – a rather unique project (a tutorial for which featured in last month’s
        magazine). We use it to build our distribution, but also packages for other distributions,
        including Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, Debian, Ubuntu and – seriously – Windows support is
        under development. Hence the OBS mainframes handle the building of over 100,000 packages
        from 25,000 users working on 15,000 different projects. OBS can provide newer packages for
        older openSUSE versions because it is easy: from the web interface our packagers just select
        the older versions and OBS takes care of it – it’s really that easy. OBS accomplishes this
        by starting a fresh virtual machine (of the chosen distro and version) for each package that
        has to be built. It then installs all build dependencies and builds the package. Any errors
        are relayed back to the packager via the web (or command-line) interface. And OBS can take
        code directly out of CVS/SVN/Git and has built-in live CD generation (so yes, an automatic
        daily live CD of Git GNOME can be accomplished with ease). It’s unique and free software, so
        OBS is used by a variety of other projects, including VLC and MeeGo. (...)</para>

        video of Aaron Seigo explaining how KDE&apos;s success as a community producing all kinds of

      <para>A little over a year ago, an article was published on the Dot titled &apos;Repositioning
        the KDE Brand&apos;. The article publicized the outcome of a process within KDE to make
        sense of the relationship between the community and its products, and to reach a durable
        solution regarding the terms that should be used to refer to both. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>There are lots of graphics software applications out there. Photoshop is the big dog on
        the block and many professional artists, cartoonists, and film makers use it for a variety
        of tasks. There are also graphics applications that rival Photoshop and do just about as
        much as Photoshop but a t a lower cost. It all depends on the job you’re tackling and how
        many digital tools you require. </para>
      <para>I’ve found that <ulink url="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</ulink> does just about all I
        need when producing my comic features. And the costs is much less than Photoshop. Gimp is
        free. And because I use <ulink url="">Linux</ulink>, The Gimp already comes pre-installed.
        When you install Linux, Gimp is right there ready to go to work for you. </para>
      <para>Gimp has all the neat little filters, bells, and whistles that all the other graphics
        software apps have. I use ‘em all, but one filter, specifically, comes in quite handy when
        drawing cartoons. (...)</para>

        roughly a month ago in Phrack, the hacker magazine. A buffer overflow in the function

        parties, who entered the project server and <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Back-door-in-ProFTPD-FTP-server-1146592.html">installed</ulink> a back door in the source code.</para>

      <para>LibreOffice, the free office productivity suite, can be enhanced with hundreds of extensions and templates. Users can download these smart extras to improve the suite’s functionality to fit their job or hobby, and developers can easily write their own add-ons and share it with millions of users worldwide.</para>
      <para>Since, at the moment, there is no reliable and stable source for downloading these handy add-ons, the LibreOffice community has put great efforts into launching a public repository. It does not only provide extensions and templates for LibreOffice, but also for OpenOffice.org and other compatible office suites. Users of these can benefit from the work and the commitment of our community, and are invited to have a look at recent versions of our product, which already has included has the most popular extensions, and comes with many new features.</para>

          url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/nepomuk-fundraiser/">fundraiser</ulink> (thank
        you so much for your support) it is time I get into more detail about what you are actually
        supporting. Originally I wanted to do that by updating nepomuk.kde.org. I will still do that
        but it will take a little more time than anticipated. Thus, I will simply start with another
        blog post. </para>
      <para>Well then, apart from cleaning out the bug database at bugs.kde.org (this will be a hard
        one), continuing to support app developers with Nepomuk integration, maintaining the whole
        Nepomuk stack, <ulink url="http://soprano.sf.net">Soprano</ulink>, the <ulink

        future (In this case the near-future roughly spans the next half year).(...)</para>

      <para>As I meet new Unix hackers using Linux or Mac, sometimes I am surprised at how few Unix tricks they know. It is sometimes painful to watch developers perform manual tasks on the shell.</para>
      <para>What follows are my recommendations on how to improve your Unix skills, with a little introduction as to why you should get each book. I have linked to each one of those books with my Amazon afiliates link, so feel free to click on those links liberally.</para>
      <para>Here is the list of books that programmers using Unix should read. It will only take you a couple of days to read them, but you will easily increase your productivity by a whole order of magnitude. (...)</para>

      <para>REDWOOD SHORES, CA--(Marketwire - Jun 1, 2011) - &quot;With today&apos;s proposal to contribute the OpenOffice.org code to The Apache Software Foundation&apos;s Incubator, Oracle continues to demonstrate its commitment to the developer and open source communities. Donating OpenOffice.org to Apache gives this popular consumer software a mature, open, and well established infrastructure to continue well into the future. The Apache Software Foundation&apos;s model makes it possible for commercial and individual volunteer contributors to collaborate on open source product development.&quot; -- Luke Kowalski, vice president, Oracle Corporate Architecture Group.

          Linux Journal/Susan Linton: The Open Source Office Software Sector Heats Up</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>The world of LibreOffice and OpenOffice(.org) has been heating up recently with several
        exciting and, at times, bewildering developments. The Document Foundation remains very
        active as is LibreOffice development, but Oracle has given up on OpenOffice and slapped
        LibreOffice in the face by giving it to Apache. Perhaps the most important announcement was
        the release of LibreOffice 3.4.0.</para>
      <para>The recent release of LibreOffice 3.4 demonstrates the very philosophical differences in
        community projects and those stifled by commercial interests. LibreOffice development has
        been happening at an unprecedented pace while OpenOffice lagged behind and lost many of its
        previous users. Even under Sun development was tightly controlled, but Oracle increased the
        bonds. In contrast, according to the <ulink
          url="http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/06/03/the-document-foundation-announces-libreoffice-3-4-0/"
          >release announcement</ulink>, LibreOffice now has 120 happy developers committing
        approximately 20 changes per day. Cedric Bosdonnat <ulink
          url="http://cedric.bosdonnat.free.fr/wordpress/?p=803">puts</ulink> the number of
        contributors at 223. Italo Vignoli is quoted as saying, "We care for our developers, and it
        shows."</para>
      <para>Just before LibreOffice 3.4 was released Oracle <ulink
          url="http://blogs.oracle.com/trond/entry/statements_on_openoffice_org_contribution"
          >announced</ulink> that it was donating OpenOffice to the Apache Software Foundation.
        Pundit have speculated all around the spectrum of how that will affect the office suite with
        some thinking it will certainly benefit while others think it will most likely wane even
        further. The Document Foundation <ulink
          url="http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/06/01/statement-about-oracles-move-to-donate-openoffice-org-assets-to-the-apache-foundation/"
          >expressed</ulink> disappointment that a reunification of the two projects will probably
        not occur but offered their best wishes for OpenOffice. They were upbeat about including
        OpenOffice code since the Apache license is <ulink
          url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/new-license-recommendations-guide"
          >compatible</ulink> with the GNU Lesser General Public License under which LibreOffice is
        released. Given these facts, "the event is neutral for The Document Foundation."

      <para>A freelance researcher named Efim Bushmanov has created a site named &quot;<ulink url="http://skype-open-source.blogspot.com/">skype-open-source</ulink>&quot; and says that he
        is reverse engineering the VoIP service Skype &quot;to make skype open source&quot;. Skype&apos;s
        proprietary protocols have allowed the company to maintain control over its peer-to-peer
        voice and video communications network and have been the subject of various types of
        research over the years.</para>
      <para>Bushmanov is not taking a clean room approach, where a researcher examines the network
        inputs and outputs of the software. He has instead opted for the potentially riskier process
          of&#160;<ulink url="http://skype-open-source.blogspot.com/2011/06/when-binary-files-is-not-just-general.html">modifying</ulink>&#160;the Skype binary files to remove autoupdate, obfuscation and
        anti-debugging measures. Bushmanov may also be taking a risk by redistributing these
        modified files; they are easier to decompile and it is easier to trace and log what the code
        does, but they are still Skype&apos;s intellectual property.</para>

      <para>I want to preface this entry by stating something very important to me and my world. I am a writer.

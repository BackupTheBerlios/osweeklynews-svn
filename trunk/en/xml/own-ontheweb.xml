        <ulink url="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/09/thoughts-about-qt-5/">QT Labs/Lars Knoll: Nokia Announces Qt 5 Plans</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Qt 4.0 was released in June 2005, almost six years ago. A lot has changed in the
        software industry over these years. While application development back then happened mostly
        on desktop systems, mobile devices connected to the web have become increasingly popular.
        User interface technology has moved from static widgets to a fluid touch based experience.
        Since Qt 4.0 we have released seven minor versions of Qt to stay ahead of development needs,
        for example by releasing Qt Quick. Within the growing Qt user base, we have had a strong
        up-take and new needs from embedded and mobile app and UI developers.</para>
      <para>To also, in the future, be a leading edge development framework across multiple
        industries, Qt needs to continue to renew itself. Qt 4 has been an evolution, and I have
        been thinking about what future Qt versions might look like from a technical perspective.
        Over the last years we have been working on laying the foundations for the next major
        release. I see Qt Quick, QML Scenegraph and Project Lighthouse– combined with an increased
        focus on Qt Webkit – as the foundation which we plan to use to move towards a new major
        release of Qt.</para>
      <para>Given that Qt is moving into open governance mode in the upcoming months, I wanted to
        share my thinking with the Qt community in order to kick off the discussions about what I
        see as the technical architecture for Qt 5. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>The recent history of new interfaces on the free desktop is not a happy one. Three years ago, the release of KDE 4.0 resulted in a user revolt whose like had never been seen. This year, the <ulink url="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3930571/Ubuntu-Unity-vs-GNOME-3-Which-is-Better.htm">releases</ulink> of GNOME 3 and Ubuntu&apos;s Unity have produced similar revolts, but on a smaller scale.

</para>
      <para>Looking at these reactions, I am starting to wonder: Are the developers of free desktops become obsessed with design principles at the expense of what users actually want? (...)</para>

          WebGL</ulink></title>
      <para>Recently Context Information Security Limited gathered a lot of attention for <ulink
          url="http://contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/">a blog post on the state of WebGL
          security</ulink>. For Mozilla, <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL"
          >WebGL</ulink> was first released in Firefox 4, and there are implementations in Chrome,
        Safari and Opera as well. The blog post outlines an abstract concern that WebGL is
        inherently insecure because it allows fairly direct access to the hardware, along with two
        specific attacks, a Denial of Service and a Cross-Domain Image Theft.</para>
      <para>The Denial of Service attack does not generally endanger user data or privacy, but it
        can be highly annoying for users, not unlike sites that pop up multiple dialogs or have
        long-running javascript that hangs the browser. The Khronos WebGL working group has been
        aware of this type of issue for some time and has discussed it openly. Shader validation can
        help somewhat, as can <ulink url="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/robustness.txt"
          >GL_ARB_robustness</ulink>, but the forthcoming GL_ARB_robustness_2 extension will help
        even more. There are also user confirmation approaches available as well depending on what
        real world data we uncover over time. (...)</para>

      <para>Few gamers will be feeling sorry for Sony and the mess caused with this PSN hacking debacle. But if you were just annoyed by what has happened, be prepared to now start getting a bit angry.

</para>
      <para>Dr. Gene Spafford, <ulink url="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/people/faculty/view/1">CERIAS Fellow</ulink> and professor of Computer Science at Purdue University, has been talking at a hearing about the PSN security breach held by the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade. He explained that independent security experts monitor Sony’s systems such as PSN, Qriocity, and SOE and report in an open forum Sony employees view about anything they find.

</para>
      <para>Those security experts apparently reported some major failings with Sony’s servers some three months before the April 17 hack occurred. These weren’t small issues, they are blatant oversights and laziness on the part of Sony’s engineering team. (...)</para>

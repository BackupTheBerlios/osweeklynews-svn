      <para>In marking 10 years of the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE) and 20 years of Linux, the SCALE team wants to incorporate an open-source approach to this year’s expo logo designs for publications and for swag. 

With this in mind, the SCALE team announces a contest to select the artwork for use on this year&apos;s t-shirts, attendee bags, and other conference materials.</para>
      <para>The designer of the winning submission will win a free pass to <ulink url="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale10x/">SCALE 10x</ulink>, including airfare within the continental United States, as well as a three-night stay at the <ulink url="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/L/LAXAHHH-LNX-20120116/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG%20target=">Hilton Los Angeles Airport</ulink>.

      </title>
      <para>Linux creator Linus Torvalds spoke at the LinuxCon Brazil event this week, and had some choice words for makers of proprietary technology, especially Apple and Microsoft. <ulink url="http://mashable.com/2011/11/18/linus-torvalds-apple-lockdown/">Mashable picked up</ulink> this dig from Linus at these tech giants, regarding the much discussed <ulink url="http://ostatic.com/blog/in-the-windows-8-vs-linux-debate-a-windows-pundit-makes-a-great-point">secure boot feature that Microsoft is backing</ulink>, which could lock Linux out of Windows 8 PCs: &quot;“Technologies that lock things down tend to lose in the end. People want freedom and markets want freedom.” Torvalds compared secure boot to Apple&apos;s use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology. Notably, Torvalds had a decidedly anti-Apple stance in the comments. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>Since the source code is usually available, software under a free or open open source license can be re-used within another software project rather easily. That is, after all, the whole point of FLOSS. But the potential for FLOSS license violations within software projects is, like any other license, always there.</para>
      <para>Critics of FLOSS licenses are usually quick to point out that the very openness of FLOSS source code actually promotes more license violations. Protect yourself, these critics urge, and avoid FLOSS altogether--or at the very least purchase commercial compliance services and products. (...)</para>

      <para>Many people think Ubuntu codenames are funny, weird, strange and what not. Do you know that all Kernel releases have their names too.</para>
      <para>Most of the Linux 2.6 and 3.x kernels include a name in the Makefile of their source trees, which can be found in the <ulink url="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Makefile">git repository</ulink>.

      <para><emphasis role="bold">While spam continues to be a major problem for email providers and consumers, spammers have come up with a new way to hide links and slip through the spam filters.</emphasis></para>
      <para>According to new information from researchers at Symantec, a group of spammers have created a group of 87 spam-friendly, public URL shortening services and are actively using them to circumvent spam filters on popular sites. Using URL shortening scripts that are free and open source, the spammers are churning spam through the service and the public is also free to create links through the URL shorteners, perhaps an attempt to pass off the links as legitimate. All the URL shorteners are using the .info domain and are being operated through contacts in Moscow as well as a hosting company in the United Kingdom. (...)</para>

      <para>One of the great things about the original Star Wars trilogy, was the “lived in”, junky, hacked together aesthetic of the Star Wars universe. Everything was a bit trashed, as if real people actually lived there. Thankfully, that’s one of the things that George Lucas hasn’t tinkered with in his endless quest to ruin the childhood memories of a generation. So it’s heartening to see this tradition carried on with the playing of the imperial death march on miscellaneous hacked together hardware. Enjoy … (...)</para>

      <para>Way back in 1999 I predicted a significant market for desktop Linux by 2005. &#160;(I was
        targeting better than Mac OS type numbers, in the 10-15% range.) &#160;It was clear back then
        that Linux had found a substantial adoption as a server OS, and it seemed only time before
        the desktop adoption rivaled at least “the other desktop”.</para>

          support for LibreOffice</ulink>

      <para>The Document Foundation today announced the first members of its Advisory Board: Google,
        SUSE, Red Hat, Freies Office Deutschland e.V., Software in the Public Interest, and the Free
        Software Foundation. The new appointees will serve for an initial term of one year.</para>
      <para>The body represents The Document Foundation’s sponsors, with each sponsor having the
        right to one representative. They will provide the future Board of Directors with advice,
        guidance and proposals, and will consult regularly on the further development of the
        Foundation and its associated projects.</para>
      <para>“<emphasis role="italic">We’re very proud, and warmly welcome the first members of the Advisory Board. Its composition shows that LibreOffice is a vendor-neutral, truly-free office suite, and confirms that The Document Foundation has created a solid base to build upon, for the community, for corporations and enterprises, and for adopters and end-users,</emphasis>” said Florian Effenberger on behalf of The Document Foundation’s
        Steering Committee. “<emphasis role="italic">With LibreOffice being downloaded from all over the world, with the community growing quickly, and with organizations and corporations showing strong support, The Document Foundation has succeeded in creating a safe, stable and secure base to ensure the future of free office suites,</emphasis>” he added.</para>

      <para>I’ve liked <ulink url="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new">Firefox</ulink> since
        it first showed up. But, this new <ulink

        concerns me. Oh, it’s a fine browser. But, it’s not a major new release. At most, I’d call
        it Firefox 4.1, but really it’s little more than Firefox 4.02.</para>
      <para>The Mozilla Foundation, following in the footsteps of <ulink
          url="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google’s Chrome Web browser</ulink>, seems to believe
        that if they keep popping out new “major” releases every six weeks, they’ll convince people
        they’re better than the competition. That seemed like a dumb idea to me when Microsoft went
        from Word for Windows 2.0 to Word for Windows 6.0 back in 1993. The idea hasn’t improved any
        with age. (...)</para>

          >Datamation/Cynthia Harvey: 50 Must-Have Open Source Apps for Your Home Office</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>These days, more and more people work at home at least part of the time. According to
        the U.S. Small Business Administration, more than half of the 29.6 million small businesses
        in the country are home-based.</para>
      <para>If you add to those figures the number of people who telecommute to their jobs part of
        the time, the Telework Research Network estimates that between 20 to 30 million people work
        from home at least once a week. And WorldatWork claims that approximately 44 million
        Americans work at home at least one day a year.</para>
      <para>Whether they work for themselves, a small business or a large multinational corporation,
        all of these workers need good software for their home offices. And many of these people who
        work at home don't have a lot of money to spend on that software -- especially if they work
        for themselves.</para>
      <para>With those workers in mind, we've created a list of open source applications that are
        the most helpful for home offices. Unlike many of our other Datamation lists, we've kept the
        number of applications in each category small—usually just the one or two top apps in each
        category. Nearly all of this software will run on Windows, and these are some of the most
        mature and user-friendly open source applications available. If you're reasonably
        tech-savvy, you should be able to set up and use any of these apps.</para>
      <para>Also, recognizing that home office computers get used for more than just work, we've
        included a mix of business software, utilities, and "fun" apps for those times when you need
        a break.</para>
      <para>As always, if you'd like to recommend another open source app that we've missed, feel
        free to add a comment below. (...)</para>

      <para>Probably the most boring open source story recently has also been the one getting the
        most ink. The problem with with the Apache/OpenOffice saga is that the real story already
        happened, it’s history.</para>
      <para>Oracle’s “gift” of OpenOffice.org to Apache, and the change of license from copyleft to
        permissive, is merely an epilogue referring back to a prologue: Oracle’s sudden ownership of
        the open source office suite as a mere byproduct of their acquisition of Sun. (...)</para>

        that the right mix of online course material and interaction with peers is what keeps the
        class motivated and achieving results. What OpenStudy is doing is working on the latter part
        of the mix. In theory, the students may learn in their real-life classrooms or working with
        online course material. But if the peers are interacting, they’ll share known resources with
        each other. It’s the other side of learning. (...)</para>

        <ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/skype-replacement-projects">Free Software Foundation/Brett Smith: Two new projects can help free software replace Skype</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Skype has been in the news a lot lately: Microsoft agreed to buy the company, their
        network has gone down twice recently, and they&apos;re threatening to take unspecified action
        against developers who try to write free software to make calls on their system. This all
        merely adds insult to injury; <ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/microsoft-skype">the software has always been nonfree</ulink>, and that&apos;s why a free software replacement for
        Skype has been on <ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/#skypereplacement">our High Priority Projects list</ulink> since October 2008. Lots of people use software like <ulink url="http://directory.fsf.org/project/ekiga/">Ekiga</ulink> and <ulink url="http://directory.fsf.org/project/twinkle/">Twinkle</ulink> to make simple VoIP calls,
        but they&apos;re still missing some features, and that prevents people from making the switch to
        using free software. Thankfully, a couple of new projects aim to close this gap, and both
        have made some promising progress over the last month.</para>
      <para>GNU Free Call wants to help people easily connect with each other without relying on any
        one centralized network. To do that, they&apos;re creating a peer-to-peer calling network, along
        with client software for traditional desktop computers and mobile devices. The project
        recently released stable call server software, <ulink url="http://planet.gnu.org/gnutelephony/?p=18">GNU SIP Witch 1.0</ulink>, and now the team
        is beginning to focus its efforts on building the client software.</para>
      <para><ulink url="http://sites.google.com/site/webrtc/">WebRTC</ulink> is coordinating an
        effort to let people call each other and hold videoconferences just by visiting a Web site.
        If they&apos;re successful, Web developers will be able to add these features to their sites just
        by using some relatively simple JavaScript code. Even better, the audio and video codecs
        WebRTC uses have free software implementations, and come with patent licenses that offer
        legal protection to users and developers. This project is still in its early stages; right
        now, the effort is focused on adding the necessary support to different browsers.</para>
      <para>If either of these projects interests you, they could both benefit from your help. The
          <ulink url="http://www.gnutelephony.org/">GNU Telephony wiki</ulink> suggests several ways
        you can get involved with the GNU Free Call project. Since WebRTC is focused on browser
        support right now, the best way to contribute is to get it integrated with your favorite
        free browser, like <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">GNU IceCat</ulink> or
        others based on Firefox. Both projects offer a great opportunity to get involved and help
        important work in the free software community.</para>

        <ulink url="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-office-software-sector-heats"> Linux Journal/Susan Linton: The Open Source Office Software Sector Heats Up</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>The world of LibreOffice and OpenOffice(.org) has been heating up recently with several
        exciting and, at times, bewildering developments. The Document Foundation remains very
        active as is LibreOffice development, but Oracle has given up on OpenOffice and slapped
        LibreOffice in the face by giving it to Apache. Perhaps the most important announcement was
        the release of LibreOffice 3.4.0.</para>
      <para>The recent release of LibreOffice 3.4 demonstrates the very philosophical differences in
        community projects and those stifled by commercial interests. LibreOffice development has
        been happening at an unprecedented pace while OpenOffice lagged behind and lost many of its
        previous users. Even under Sun development was tightly controlled, but Oracle increased the
        bonds. In contrast, according to the <ulink url="http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/06/03/the-document-foundation-announces-libreoffice-3-4-0/">release announcement</ulink>, LibreOffice now has 120 happy developers committing
        approximately 20 changes per day. Cedric Bosdonnat <ulink url="http://cedric.bosdonnat.free.fr/wordpress/?p=803">puts</ulink> the number of
        contributors at 223. Italo Vignoli is quoted as saying, &quot;We care for our developers, and it
        shows.&quot;</para>
      <para>Just before LibreOffice 3.4 was released Oracle <ulink url="http://blogs.oracle.com/trond/entry/statements_on_openoffice_org_contribution">announced</ulink> that it was donating OpenOffice to the Apache Software Foundation.
        Pundit have speculated all around the spectrum of how that will affect the office suite with
        some thinking it will certainly benefit while others think it will most likely wane even
        further. The Document Foundation <ulink url="http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/06/01/statement-about-oracles-move-to-donate-openoffice-org-assets-to-the-apache-foundation/">expressed</ulink> disappointment that a reunification of the two projects will probably
        not occur but offered their best wishes for OpenOffice. They were upbeat about including
        OpenOffice code since the Apache license is <ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/new-license-recommendations-guide">compatible</ulink> with the GNU Lesser General Public License under which LibreOffice is
        released. Given these facts, &quot;the event is neutral for The Document Foundation.&quot;

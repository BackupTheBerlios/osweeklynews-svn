      </title>
      <para>Several developers approached me and asked for more time to port their applications. So
        we extend the deadline of the contest to 31. of march. Everybody has one more month to port
        a KDE or Qt application to Symbian or MeeGo. Remember that you can win 10.000,- so please
        consider to make your KDE or Qt application ready for mobile. </para>
      <para>You find more informatiuon in the original contest announcement: <ulink url="http://blog.karlitschek.de/2010/12/qtest-mobile-app-port-contest-launched.html">http://blog.karlitschek.de/2010/12/qtest-mobile-app-port-contest-launched.html</ulink>
      </para>
      <para>Please make sure that you also provide binaries for you applications. This makes is a
        lot easier for the jury to test you application. Have fun and good luck.</para>

        <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-net-attack/">Sourceforge: Sourceforge.net attack</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Yesterday our vigilant operations guys detected a targeted attack against some of our
        developer infrastructure. The attack resulted in an exploit of several SourceForge.net
        servers, and we have proactively shut down a handful of developer centric services to
        safeguard data and protect the majority of our services. </para>
      <para>Our immediate priorities are to prevent further exposure and ensure data integrity.
        We’ve had all hands on deck working on identifying the exploit vector or vectors,
        eliminating them, and are now focusing on verifying data integrity and restoring the
        impacted services. </para>
      <para>The problem was initially discovered on the servers that host CVS but our analysis
        indicates that several other machines were involved, and while we believe we’ve determined
        the extent of the attack, we are verifying all of our other services and data. </para>
      <para>As a short term response, we’ve taken down the following services to prevent any
        possible escalation:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>CVS Hosting</para>
          </listitem>

            <para>Interactive Shell services</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>Once the immediate response to this attack is over, we will be providing a much more
        detailed account of what’s happened, and what specific actions we are taking to prevent
        further exploits.</para>

      </title>
      <para>Recent meetings held among the RedHat, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, and
        Mageia communities has resulted in an informal agreement on an architecture for a common app
        installer API. Yet the dream of a universal GNU/Linux app-store may be much farther off. </para>
      <para>Word of the app-installer meetings at OpenSUSE&apos;s Nuremberg, Germany, offices earlier
        this month emerged last week in a <ulink url="http://blog.karlitschek.de/2011/01/2-amazing-meetings-to-change-world.html">blog post</ulink> by OpenDesktop.org&apos;s Frank Karlitschek on Jan. 24. This was followed by a
        more detailed Jan. 26 report on the meetings by Swapnil Bhartiya <ulink url="http://www.muktware.com/a/1/4/26/2011/709?page=0,0">in <emphasis role="italic">Muktware</emphasis></ulink>. </para>
      <para>On Jan. 31, LinuxInsider&apos;s Katherine Noyes <ulink url="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/Linux-and-the-Great-App-Store-Agenda-71752.html">sampled the Linux blogs and forums</ulink> for feedback, and found general support for a
        common app installer, but with plenty of observers predicting doom for the project. The more
        distant dream of a common app-store for Linux, which was not formally discussed at the main
        Nuremberg meetings, seemed even more far-fetched to many, though many others deem it a
        worthy goal. </para>
      <para>Having a common installer -- and ultimately, a universal app store -- should help
        attract new users and third-party developers to desktop Linux, goes the general consensus.
        It would help to cushion the fragmentation of the desktop Linux market while easing the pain
        of dealing with the complexity of most package managers. Yet, many other attempts at unified
        standards among Linux communities have ended in failure, note skeptics. </para>

      <para>It's been nearly a year since the last major release of Firefox -- version 3.6 -- and
        development of the Firefox 4 seems to have slowed down a bit, with the planned release of
        late 2010 getting set back to <ulink
          url="http://www.itworld.com/internet/133594/mozilla-pushes-devs-make-feb-ship-date-firefox-4"
          >February 2011</ulink>. </para>
      <para>Much of this development has been wrapped up in adding HTML 5 features to the open
        source browser, so the delay, while not greeted with much enthusiasm amongst Firefox users,
        hasn't created a lot of fussing, either. </para>
      <para>Nor has it slowed down the development of the vast array of extensions available for
        Firefox, as developers find new and creative ways to view and interact with the web every
        day. Extensions are one of Firefox's most powerful feature sets, since their ease-of-use and
        extensibility enables users to build exactly the kind of browser they need. With more than
        5,000 add-ons available, there's a lot of customization options to chose from, and some of
        them have to be better than others. </para>
      <para>So, which ones do you simply need to have? That will be the focus of this series, which
        will review the best Firefox extensions in several categories, then round up the most
        popular Firefox extensions of all as of the end of 2010. The categories are built around
        Mozilla's own classifications, but grouped together in ways we think makes more sense.

        I have normalized the charted data, and eliminated the raw numbers on the Y-axes. Those who
        wish to run similar tests on their own systems can download a tarball containing the testing
        scripts; I’ll provide the link to the tarball at the end of this report. (...)</para>

      <para>I’m usually big on milestones — anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, etc. But it wasn’t until I was going to bed last night that it hit me: It’s been a year since I left Novell and started working for myself full-time. Here’s how it’s going so far… (read on if you’re interested, but this is mostly full of personal stuff so feel free to skip down to some of the more interesting stuff on technology if you like…)</para>
      <para>My last day with Novell was January 31st, 2010. Pretty much exactly two years after I started with the company (February 1st, 2008). I put in notice about two weeks before that, but had been considering quitting long before. I’m not going to go into a lot of backstory here, but the long and short of it was that after two years the job was not what I wanted to be doing. Some jobs you can do whether your heart is in them or not (I worked at a car seat factory for three and a half years, and I don’t think my heart was ever in that…), but community management is something that you need to be all-in for.

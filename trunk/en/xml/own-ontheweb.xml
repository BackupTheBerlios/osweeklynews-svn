          >Attachmate/Open Letter to Novell Customers</ulink></title>
      <para>Since the announcement of our intent to acquire Novell, we have received a number of
        questions regarding our plans for supporting Novell products. I know that during this period
        between the announcement and closing, there are more questions than answers, and I am
        sensitive to the challenges that this uncertainty may create for Novell customers and
        partners. I want to take this opportunity to be clear about the commitments we make to all
        of our customers. </para>
      <para>Attachmate is committed to delivering quality products, providing exceptional customer
        service, and being easy to do business with. We are excited about the opportunity to make
        these same commitments to Novell customers after closing. To ensure that we do so,
        Attachmate will support the existing roadmaps and release schedules for products across the
        Novell and SUSE portfolios. </para>
      <para>It is also important for our existing and future customers to know that we have a proven
        history of supporting our solutions throughout their product lifecycles. Our philosophy is
        to create options for customers to move forward, not force them to abandon products that
        have become critical to their operation and success. We will continue to invest in both the
        innovation of next-generation products and the nurturing of more mature and widely adopted
        solutions. We understand that our customers’ success depends on having the flexibility to
        evolve and adopt new technologies at their own pace and cadence. We intend to support that
        need. </para>
      <para>As we look forward to 2011 and beyond, our excitement continues to grow about the
        potential addition of Novell and SUSE to our portfolio and the opportunity that they create
        to deliver increasing value to our combined customer base. I look forward to sharing more
        details and specifics about those plans once the transaction has closed.</para>

          Linux</ulink></title>
      <para>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the two major companies specialized in
        programmable graphics processor technologies, released a couple of days ago new and improved
        versions of their video drivers for Linux systems, available for both x86 and x86_64
        architectures. </para>
      <para>AMD's ATI Catalyst 10.12 was released on December 13th and introduces support for the
        Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) operating system, support for the upcoming GNOME 3 desktop
        environment, and various fixes and improvements, especially to the
        GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap OpenGL extension. The software version was updated to 8.801. </para>
      <para>On the other hand, the new Nvidia Display Driver 260.19.29, also released on December
        13th, introduces support for new GPUs, such as GeForce GTX 460 SE, GeForce GTX 570, Quadro
        5000M, NVS 300. Among the release highlights we can mention: <itemizedlist>

        Revealed</ulink></title>
      <para>The VAR Guy did some digging and found an SEC filing that more fully describes Novell’s
        pending sale to Attachmate. The filing describes how J.P. Morgan, working on Novell’s
        behalf, shopped Novell around to multiple bidders, and Novell mulled potential deals
        involving Microsoft and other unnamed companies. Novell even considered running SUSE Linux
        as a standalone business. Here’s the story only The VAR Guy took the time to pursue. </para>
      <para>Overall, Novell representatives contacted 52 potential buyers. Roughly nine official
        bidders emerged. So how did Attachmate wind up buying the bulk of Novell’s assets? And what
        happened to rumored SUSE Linux bids from VMware? In a preliminary <ulink

          >proxy statement</ulink> dated December 14, Novell offers an extensive time line
        describing how the company’s board of directors, executive team, and external financial
        advisors pursued potential buyers for the company. The filing is more than 100 pages. Here
        are some of the highlights, paraphrased by The VAR Guy. Please note:<itemizedlist>

            <para>Novell protects the names of several bidders, referring to them as Party A through
              Party E. In some cases, The VAR Guy makes some educated guesses about the actual
              identity of each company. But The VAR Guy’s educated guesses could be wrong.

          Akonadi Google Resource: Tasks support</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>As the title says, I just added support for Google Tasks by creating the Akonadi Google
        Tasks Resource. The Tasks API provided by Google is really simple and does not support many
        properties, only name, summary, due to date, completed date and status. You can’t set
        progress percentage, start date, attendees nor reminders (this sucks!). Despite the fact,
        that the API provides means for tree-like structure of tasks (tasks and subtasks), it does
        not seem to work. So you can only have a linear list of tasks. A positive thing is, that due
        to this limited functionality of Google Tasks the resource has a full support of this
        API.</para>
      <para>The reason for independent resource is that you can have multiple task lists in Google
        Calendar, thus merging this functionality into Google Calendar Resource is not an option.
        Unfortunately, you will now have the tasks resources displayed in the list of calendar
        resources in KOrganizer. (...)</para>

      <para>The Linux kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science

      </title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Distributors lose their rights when they violate GPLv2, but the Free Software Foundation is more forgiving in its license enforcement to encourage continued participation in the free software community. GPLv3 has improved termination provisions to codify this approach, giving developers one more reason to upgrade.</emphasis></para>
      <para>Thanks to Android&apos;s commercial success, the kernel Linux, which is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, is being distributed more than ever before. Whenever someone distributes GPL-covered software, they must follow a few conditions set forth in the license. These conditions try to give anyone who receives the software both the legal permission and the practical tools necessary to change and share the software themselves if they wish.</para>
      <para>Not all of the companies that distribute Android heed these conditions. We&apos;ve witnessed an uptick in GPL violation reports—some convincing, others incomplete or misinformed—against these vendors. We generally can&apos;t pursue these violations directly, because only copyright holders can enforce free software licenses in most countries, and few Android devices use FSF-copyrighted code. However, people still seek out our opinions about the relevant parts of the GPL, and that discussion has recently turned to GPLv2&apos;s termination provisions. Section 4 of the license says, “You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.” (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>If you guessed again that there isn&apos;t much else to write about, you&apos;d be right! That&apos;s why I&apos;m looking at openSUSE 11.4 GNOME today.</para>
      <para>A few months ago, I took a look at openSUSE 11.4 KDE. Before that, I had compared openSUSE 11.3 KDE to other distributions that primarily used KDE. I found that version 11.4 was a dramatic improvement over version 11.3, to the point where I heartily recommended it to anyone who wanted to try it. It was fairly fast, stable, looked great, and had or could easily get all the applications I wanted. But to call openSUSE a primarily KDE distribution is slightly misleading, because while openSUSE does indeed try to promote KDE a little more, it puts just as much effort into making the GNOME edition a unique experience as well. Plus, the developers that created openSUSE also created Mono, which is basically the C# programming language for Linux, and helped develop the applications written in it that are now popularly used in many GNOME distributions, such as the Evolution mail client (UPDATE: Evolution is not written in Mono, though it was developed by the same group/a group close to that one that developed openSUSE — thanks to an anonymous reader for the correction), Tomboy note-taking application, F-Spot photo manager, and GNOME-Do launcher. So I figured it&apos;s time to see what openSUSE GNOME is really like. (...)</para>

      <para>Open source activists Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner announce the launch today of the
        Ada Initiative (http://adainitiative.org/), a non-profit organization to promote
        women&apos;s participation in open technology and culture. </para>
      <para>Open technology and culture, including open source software, open content, and related
        communities, suffer from a dearth of women at all levels. &quot;Open technology and culture
        are shaping our future and must reflect all people. Involving more women in the creation of
        our future is a critical step in building a healthy Internet world,&quot; says Mitchell
        Baker, chair of the Mozilla Foundation. The Ada Initiative will concentrate on focused,
        direct action programs, including recruitment and training for women, education for
        community members, and working with companies and projects to improve their outreach to
        women. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>&quot;Joe “Zonker” Brockmeier wrote an <ulink url="http://www.networkworld.com/community/banshee-amazon-store-disabled-by-canonical-in-ubuntu">interesting article</ulink> on Open Source Report about the Banshee Amazon store in Ubuntu 11.04. To quickly summarize the situation, Banshee will be the new default music player in Ubuntu. Let me say up front, as a disclaimer: Banshee is to a large extent being developed by my employer, Novell. Banshee has support for the Amazon music store and includes a referral code in there, as you’d expect. The benefits of this amount to around $10,000 per year right now, which goes to the GNOME Foundation. Sadly, Canonical recently visited the Banshee mailing list and told them the Amazon store had to go. It could stay, they said, but only if Banshee gave 75% of the earnings to Canonical instead of GNOME. The Banshee developers graciously declined. Now Banshee (in Ubuntu at least) will have Ubuntu One as default music store and users will have to enable Amazon by themselves. (...)&quot;</para>

      </title>
      <para>&quot;For some time now, I have been meaning to write a series of blog posts setting forth my views on best practices in forming and governing open source foundations.  Why?  Because despite the increasing reliance of just about every part of our modern world (government, finance, defense, and so on) on open source software (OSS) and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), there has been very little written on the subject.

</para>
      <para>That means that neither a community nor a corporation has much to refer to in creating the kind of governance structure most likely to ensure that the intentions of the founders are carried out, that the rights of contributors are respected, and that the code upon which end users will rely is properly maintained into the future.

      </title>
      <para>&quot;When I read with disappointed interest the news that the <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/No-more-desktop-Linux-systems-in-the-German-Foreign-Office-1191122.html">German Foreign Office had decided to migrate back to Windows</ulink> after having deployed Linux on their office desktops in 2005, my immediate reaction was one of resignation.

</para>
      <para>That&apos;s a change from my younger days, when I would see such reverse migrations as carefully staged Microsoft PR events designed purposely to embarrass Linux on the desktop. I would hear comments such as &quot;it was too hard to train users&quot; on Linux and cries of &quot;FUD!&quot; and &quot;Hokum!&quot; would sail out from my keyboard.

</para>
      <para>Training people to use Linux, I would reason, is no harder than training them to use Windows or OS X. Any statements to the contrary, I would further argue, were merely playing to the cameras. Such brashness came from my experience in learning all sorts of platforms from scratch. And there&apos;s where I went wrong. (...)&quot;</para>

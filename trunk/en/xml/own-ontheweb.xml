      <para>Ada Initiative launches to promote women in open technology and culture </para>
      <para>Open source activists Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner announce the launch today of the
        Ada Initiative (http://adainitiative.org/), a non-profit organization to promote
        women&apos;s participation in open technology and culture. </para>
      <para>Open technology and culture, including open source software, open content, and related
        communities, suffer from a dearth of women at all levels. &quot;Open technology and culture
        are shaping our future and must reflect all people. Involving more women in the creation of
        our future is a critical step in building a healthy Internet world,&quot; says Mitchell
        Baker, chair of the Mozilla Foundation. The Ada Initiative will concentrate on focused,
        direct action programs, including recruitment and training for women, education for
        community members, and working with companies and projects to improve their outreach to
        women. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>&quot;Joe “Zonker” Brockmeier wrote an <ulink url="http://www.networkworld.com/community/banshee-amazon-store-disabled-by-canonical-in-ubuntu">interesting article</ulink> on Open Source Report about the Banshee Amazon store in Ubuntu 11.04. To quickly summarize the situation, Banshee will be the new default music player in Ubuntu. Let me say up front, as a disclaimer: Banshee is to a large extent being developed by my employer, Novell. Banshee has support for the Amazon music store and includes a referral code in there, as you’d expect. The benefits of this amount to around $10,000 per year right now, which goes to the GNOME Foundation. Sadly, Canonical recently visited the Banshee mailing list and told them the Amazon store had to go. It could stay, they said, but only if Banshee gave 75% of the earnings to Canonical instead of GNOME. The Banshee developers graciously declined. Now Banshee (in Ubuntu at least) will have Ubuntu One as default music store and users will have to enable Amazon by themselves. (...)&quot;</para>

      <para>Many people think that Linux is immune to the type of Autorun attacks that have plagued
        Windows systems with malware over the years. However, there have been many advances in the
        usability of Linux as a desktop OS - including the addition of features that can allow

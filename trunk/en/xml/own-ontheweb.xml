          Akonadi Google Resource: complete rewrite</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>today I finally pushed a completely new version of the Akonadi Google Resource. Since
        last update cca 2 months ago I’ve completely rewritten the resources, moving most of the
        functionality into libKGoogle . The library now provides access to Google services and can
        be easily used by any other project. So what’s new? A lot of things changed for programmers.
        I’ve begun to fulfill my threats about providing a C++/Qt library for accessing Google
        Services. It’s not pure Qt, I’m using some KDE stuff in there, but that will change.</para>
      <para>LibKGoogle now provides API similar to QNetworkAccessManager (KGoogleAccessManager)
        through which you can send KGoogleRequest and if it works, you’ll receive a KGoogleReply.
        Each Google Service is represented by a KGoogleService subclass, implementing XML and/or
        JSON parser and serializer and providing informations about fetch/create/update URLs. Each
        object (contact, event, calendar) is represented by KGoogleObject subclass. For now, Event
        class is implements KCalCore::Event as well, ýthe Calendar and Contact classes provide their
        own implementation of everything. Porting it to KABC/KCalCore is on TODO. (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>The Linux kernel development process may be getting a little tweaking if a proposal by -stable kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman is accepted; tweaking needed to meet growing commercial interest in Linux.</para>
      <para>The proposal is simple, on the surface and all the way down: Currently, the 2.6.32 kernel is maintained as a -longterm kernel, a kernel release that is maintained as a stable release with bug fixes and patches for a relatively lengthy period of time. This is opposed to the official -stable release of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel release most suitable for general use, and is dropped when the next release is moved into the -stable category. (The current -stable release, for example, is the 3.0.1 kernel.) (...)</para>

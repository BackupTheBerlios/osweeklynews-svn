      <para>&quot;Given the breadth of interest in free personal productivity applications and the rapid evolution of personal computing technologies, we believe the OpenOffice.org project would be best managed by an organization focused on serving that broad constituency on a non-commercial basis,&quot; said Edward Screven, Oracle&apos;s Chief Corporate Architect. &quot;We intend to begin working immediately with community members to further the continued success of Open Office. Oracle will continue to strongly support the adoption of open standards-based document formats, such as the Open Document Format (ODF).&quot; (...)</para>

      </title>
      <para>A jury has found that in using Linux on its back-end servers, Google has infringed a patent held by a small Texas-based company and must pay $5m in damages.

</para>
      <para>In 2006, Bedrock Computer Technologies sued Google and several other outfits – including Yahoo!, Amazon.com, PayPal, and AOL – claiming they infringed on a patent filed in January 1997. The patent describes &quot;a method and apparatus for performing storage and retrieval...that uses the hashing technique with the external chaining method for collision resolution&quot;, and the accusation is that companies infringed by using various versions of the Linux kernel on their servers.

</para>
      <para>At least some of those sued were using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on the back-end. Google apparently uses its own version of Linux across its famously distributed infrastructure.

      </title>
      <para> You know I&apos;m considering ditching Gnome for good, especially <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3.html">after</ulink> sampling the latest
        version, Gnome 3. While the <ulink url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3-fallback.html">Fallback Mode</ulink>
        offers some solace, it&apos;s a far cry from the fully usable desktop that I want and need. It&apos;s
        also a manifestation of a disturbing trend of equating power computing with the touch-screen
        nonsense of inferior mobile computing, but more about later. </para>
      <para> I&apos;m looking at all kinds of alternatives. The most prominent one is KDE4, which
        has turned great with version 4.6. Featured in <ulink
          url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/pardus-2011.html">Pardus 2011</ulink> and <ulink
          url="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/opensuse-11sp4-kde.html">openSUSE 11.4</ulink>,
        it&apos;s a streamlined, well-packaged environment that can almost turn a Gnome head around,
        back to the glory days when KDE reigned supreme. But there&apos;s another project you may
        want to test, and it&apos;s called Trinity KDE. </para>

      </title>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">&quot;What I was proud of was that I used very few parts to build a computer that could actually speak words on a screen and type words on a keyboard and run a programming language that could play games. And I did all this myself&quot;</emphasis> – Steve Wozniak

</para>
      <para>For some users computer games are little more than &quot;the things I do when I should be working&quot;, a soothing distraction or a waste of time and space. For others games are a matter of life and death, the bane of partners, the be all and end all of computing, and the reason why we bother. So the addicts are pleased to go out and buy an XBox, a Nintendo or a PlayStation 3 rather than a full-blown computer, and are happy to play the night away.

</para>
      <para>The best games are a learning experience, an exercise in strategic thinking, memory retention, what-if scenarios and problem solving – not unlike programming itself. Each piece in a game like chess has a limited number of moves, yet the game itself is a world of possibilities, and like a chess player, a programmer has to think ahead, so it isn&apos;t really surprising that many coders approach programming as if it was a game of chess, and are also gamers.

      </title>
      <para>I have to admit, over the years I haven’t given openSUSE enough love or credit for being
        the outstanding Linux distribution is it. With that said, I wanted to give some attention to
        the latest release coming out of the openSUSE project. And, since the default desktop for
        openSUSE 11.4 is KDE, I will be giving a little extra attention to the KDE desktop. Since
        both might well gain some serious ground, when Ubuntu 11.04 is released, it will be nice for
        users to not only know of its existence, but to also know that openSUSE 11.4 is, in fact, a
        solid distribution worth giving a look. (...)</para>

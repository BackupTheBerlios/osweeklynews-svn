      <title><ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Amarok-2-4-Beta-1-adds-new-features-1149453.html">Amarok 2.4 Beta 1 adds new features</ulink></title>
      <para>The <ulink url="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</ulink> development team has released a first beta for version 2.4 of the open source music player for the KDE desktop, code named "Closer". According to the developers, the first beta is aimed at developers and early adopters and includes a number of new features that require "a lot of testing to make sure they are top-notch for final release at the beginning of 2011".
      </para>
      <para>The 2.4 Beta 1 release features a completely re-written collection scanner that better detects compilations, the option to have Amarok write statistics and album covers back to the files directly and the inclusion of <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding">transcoding</ulink> support â€“ the developers note that transcoding will be expanded to media devices in a future release. A new applet for guitar and bass tab information, map and calendar views for the upcoming events applet, and the new Playdar collection that allows users to listen to music provided by a local Playdar service have also been added. Other changes include an option to show and hide the menu bar, a mass-tagging user interface using the <ulink url="http://musicbrainz.org/">Musicbrainz</ulink> open content music database and support for the third generation iPod Touch.
      </para>
      <para>As with all development releases, use in production environments and on mission critical systems is not advised. Users testing the release are encouraged to provide feedback and <ulink url="http://bugs.kde.org/">report</ulink> any bugs that they encounter.
      </para>

      <para>Way back in 1999 I predicted a significant market for desktop Linux by 2005. &#160;(I was
        targeting better than Mac OS type numbers, in the 10-15% range.) &#160;It was clear back then
        that Linux had found a substantial adoption as a server OS, and it seemed only time before
        the desktop adoption rivaled at least “the other desktop”.</para>

      </title>
      <para>The Document Foundation today announced the first members of its Advisory Board: Google,
        SUSE, Red Hat, Freies Office Deutschland e.V., Software in the Public Interest, and the Free
        Software Foundation. The new appointees will serve for an initial term of one year.</para>
      <para>The body represents The Document Foundation’s sponsors, with each sponsor having the
        right to one representative. They will provide the future Board of Directors with advice,
        guidance and proposals, and will consult regularly on the further development of the
        Foundation and its associated projects.</para>
      <para>“<emphasis role="italic">We’re very proud, and warmly welcome the first members of the Advisory Board. Its composition shows that LibreOffice is a vendor-neutral, truly-free office suite, and confirms that The Document Foundation has created a solid base to build upon, for the community, for corporations and enterprises, and for adopters and end-users,</emphasis>” said Florian Effenberger on behalf of The Document Foundation’s
        Steering Committee. “<emphasis role="italic">With LibreOffice being downloaded from all over the world, with the community growing quickly, and with organizations and corporations showing strong support, The Document Foundation has succeeded in creating a safe, stable and secure base to ensure the future of free office suites,</emphasis>” he added.</para>

Many of its founders were members of <ulink url="http://go-oo.org">Go-OO</ulink>, the sometimes controversial not-quite-fork, so LibreOffice looked like simply a continuation of GO-OO under another name. However, since last week, when Oracle <ulink url="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/statements-on-openofficeorg-contribution-to-apache-nasdaq-orcl-1521400.htm">donated</ulink> OpenOffice.org to the Apache Software Foundation, LibreOffice.org is looking more and more like the natural heir of the original OpenOffice.org -- by which I mean the project that will do the free software community the most benefit..

        of the mix. In theory, the students may learn in their real-life classrooms or working with
        online course material. But if the peers are interacting, they’ll share known resources with
        each other. It’s the other side of learning. (...)</para>

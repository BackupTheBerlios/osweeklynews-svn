      <para>The KDE desktop is about to take a major step forward, with the announcement today of
        the roadmap for KDE Frameworks 5.0.</para>
      <para>Most eyes in the Linux desktop world are on the Berlin Desktop Summit this week, as
        members of the GNOME and KDE camps come together for a joint technical conference running
        from August 6-12 at Humboldt University in Berlin. Currently, KDE seems to be making the
        most strides in the joint event, with the surprise announcement of the KDE 5.0 roadmap,
        which was revealed by KDE developer Aaron Seigo in his blog Sunday.</para>
      <para>According to Seigo, the new KDE Frameworks roadmap, which will encompass "the next major
        release of KDE's libraries and runtime requirements," will have an "emphasis... on
        modularity, dependency clarity/simplification and increasing quality to the next level."

      <para>It was big news when the 3.0 kernel was released at the end of July, but as luck would

        don&apos;t worry. It&apos;s the distros that implement the FHS — when it goes well, all you know is
        that your system runs smoothly. But that doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s nothing important hidden away

Yes, Richard Stallman has sent out a note letting everybody know that the 23.2 and 23.3 releases of GNU Emacs are in violation of the GPL. Says Stallman, &quot;We have made a very bad mistake. Anyone redistributing those versions is violating the GPL, through no fault of his own.&quot; (...)</para>

      <para>NetAFP, the Netatalk developers, have announced that they are to resume open development of Netatalk and have updated the project&apos;s git repository with the latest source. In early July, NetAFP, the Netatalk developers, <ulink url="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Current-Netatalk-code-only-with-cash-say-developers-1273711.html">announced</ulink> they were only making the source code for Netatalk 2.2.0 available to paying customers.

      <para>Florian Effenberger recently posted statistics of the number of developers contributing to the LibreOffice project. Several months ago, Cedric Bosdonnat offered data on the number of contribution and contributors from the various sources. While Effenberger&apos;s post provides much less detail, it still provides a glimpse into the composition of the growing community.</para>
      <para>According to commit counts it seems 54 developers from Oracle, everybody&apos;s favorite bad guy these days, has the highest employee count. This was a full 18% of all commits. As Italo Vignoli explained, &quot;Oracle contributions are related to the OOo code that has been merged with LibreOffice, and in fact the number of commits has decreased dramatically during the last few months. There are, though, some former Oracle developers contributing on a volunteer basis to LibreOffice.&quot; (...)</para>

        got myself a phone that is, well, ‘just a phone’. Upon reflection, all I needed was the
        ability to receive calls and SMS messages and, rarely, make some calls. If I couldn’t
        upgrade the software versions, its value as a playground for experimenting with mobile
        applications was very limited. (...)</para>

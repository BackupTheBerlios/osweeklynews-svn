      <para>SUSE, a new business unit of The Attachmate Group, today announced its organizational focus on developing, marketing and supporting a portfolio of innovative solutions centered around SUSE® Linux Enterprise, the most interoperable platform for <ulink url="http://www.novell.com/linux/missioncritical.html">mission-critical computing</ulink> across physical, virtual and cloud environments. Nils Brauckmann, a 20-year industry veteran with both Attachmate and Novell® heritage, will lead the SUSE organization&apos;s passionate commitment to quality engineering, excellent customer service and open source innovation.</para>
      <para>(...)</para>
      <para>&quot;I am thrilled to lead this business and team in our pursuit of providing comprehensive Linux solutions that solve real problems for IT and the line of business. With a laser focus on making SUSE successful, we are committed to the products and services that our customers and partners rely on to run their businesses. Moreover, we recognize and celebrate the value of the <ulink url="http://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</ulink> Project and will remain a strong supporter of the openSUSE community,&quot; said Brauckmann. &quot;We reiterate our long-term commitment to the open source communities at the heart of our ecosystem. Our presence in these communities will help our customers benefit from the rich value of Linux, while encouraging the collaboration that has made Linux the foundation of so many computing environments today.&quot;</para>
      <para>Leading SUSE from its newly based headquarters in Nuremberg, Germany, Brauckmann and his team of experienced industry executives will be responsible for the organization&apos;s continued development and sale of solutions based on SUSE Linux Enterprise, through the Open Platform Solutions division of the former Novell, Inc. Specifically, Brauckmann will drive SUSE sales, marketing, engineering, technical support and consulting and training services that align with customer needs and demands. He will passionately advocate enterprise adoption of open source solutions and support the activities of the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Project">openSUSE community</ulink>.

        Brauckmann about his new position and how the changes in the SUSE division will affect
        openSUSE. The H pointed out to Brauckmann that there was only one mention of <ulink url="http://www.opensuse.org/en/">openSUSE</ulink> in the press release on SUSE and that
        might be taken to mean that the open source version of SUSE Linux was being downgraded. </para>

        happy with the renewed focus and the revitalised brand&quot; said Brauckmann, who also pointed
        out that many SUSE developers are also openSUSE contributors. He hoped to enable them to
        make more effective contributions in future by providing tools to help enhance and automate
        Q&amp;A, build and test processes too. Support can also include funding too he noted and, as

      <para>While many people use Skype for its free voice over IP (VoIP) services, Linux users have
        a love/hate relationship with it. Yes, Skype will run on some versions of Linux, but it
        doesn't run on all of them, and the Linux version (2.2-beta) lags far behind the Windows
        version (Skype 5.3). That's three major generations behind. Need I say more?</para>
      <para>Much as I dislike <ulink

        will become better for Linux with Microsoft. After all, it couldn't be much worse!</para>
      <para>That said, there are numerous Linux VoIP programs and they're also free as in "free
        beer," as well as free as in "free software." Most of these programs use the open SIP
          (<ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">Session Initiation Protocol</ulink>)
        standard or Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (<ulink url="http://xmpp.org/"
          >XMPP</ulink>) If they use the same protocol, you should be able to use one client to call
        another. To do this, of course, they must be on the same SIP or XMPP network. For example, I
        use the <xref linkend=""/>Ekiga.net VoIP network for SIP calls. </para>

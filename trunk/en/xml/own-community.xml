          Poortvliet: Strategy voting has started!</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Awesomeness!!! Yup - we've got a strategy proposal under vote. Sorry it took so long.
        Everyone, both from the board and the strategy team, has been busy with the <ulink
          url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/03/10/opensuse-11-4/">openSUSE 11.4</ulink> release and
        the <ulink
          url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/"
          >upcoming openSUSE conference</ulink>. But the board has asked Thomas Thym to get it out 2
        weeks ago and he asked me to create a openSUSE Members poll (he's not a member yet). And I
        did. So if you're an openSUSE member, go to <ulink url="http://bit.ly/kZaAC2"
          >connect.opensuse.org</ulink> and cast your vote!</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Meaning</emphasis></para>
      <para>I've blogged before about <ulink
          url="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2010/08/kde-strategy-for-opensuse.html">what this
          strategy is and isn't about</ulink> but I'd like to re-iterate it one more time. </para>
      <para>No, it's not about finding a perfect description of all of us. We're way too diverse for
        that to ever work. It also isn't about carefully describing a grand, detailed plan for what
        we will do. We don't tell our contributors what they can and can't work on. And it's not
        about writing a sexy and engaging text. The marketing team will do the marketing texts, this
        is too much based on compromise for that to be possible. </para>
      <para>It <emphasis role="bold">is</emphasis> about having a reasonably accurate description of
        who we are, what we want and where we stand. </para>
      <para>Yes, it does say some things about where we might not want to go or where we focus. That
        is because the majority of us focuses on certain things and doesn't care about other things.
        IF someone wants to take those things on, change that focus, fine. But they have to be
        prepared to do a LOT of work and get little support. In a sense, this 'strategy' can tell
        people they should join openSUSE because we are the perfect community to do what they want.
        Or not... </para>
      <para>Now surely we can and will revise it in the future, but in small steps. We'll update it
        if people start doing cool new stuff, for example. We already had to add <ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</ulink> and <ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink>! And if enough people
        want to work on mobile devices, ARM or other stuff - well, we just do it and then change our
        'strategy'. </para>
      <para>So, now go to <ulink url="http://bit.ly/kZaAC2">connect.opensuse.org</ulink> and cast
        your vote!</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Green Picture in the Article</emphasis></para>
      <para>On the green "I want you" picture on <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org"
          >news.opensuse.org</ulink>: I got it off the web and used <ulink url="http://krita.org/"
          >Krita</ulink> to make it green. I know, Krita is meant as an artist tool, a painting app.
        Wrong tool for the job. I just didn't think about using the Gimp... Actually, on my laptop I
        usually use <ulink url="http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/326">Showfoto</ulink> for these
        things which is far superior to both for basic photo manipulation. Forgot to use that too.
        Yes, right tool for the job isn't always high on my agenda, hehe. </para>
      <para>The image in the previous <ulink
          url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/01/first-step-towards-12-1-with-milestone-1/"
          >Milestone 1</ulink> article WAS made with the right tool: Krita again. Just 5 minutes
        with the right brushes and layers and it's awesome... Obviously, this is NOT a serious
        proposal for openSUSE 12.1 artwork. </para>

      <para>I’m 32 and live in the Boston area. I’ve been working on Linux since 1999 and with SUSE
        since 2000. I started working with Linux by just hacking on small things and then moving on
        to specialize in file systems. These days I lead one of the SUSE Labs kernel teams, still
        focus on file systems, but also am involved in the technical leadership for the kernel in
        all SUSE and openSUSE products.</para>

        of GSoC, we will focus a bit more on our students in the next time. Its time for a PooS

      <para>We set up the booth as an openSUSE Community. All the related stuff (about Medical and
        openSUSE) was available around the booth. Furthermore me and Stathis Iosifidis informed
        people about the openSUSE Project and openSUSE Medical Project as well as the applications
        which are available via the openSUSE Medical Distro. Efstathios Agrapidis also made an
        introductory presentation about OBS. The presentation rolled out smoothly. Although there
        wasn't enough time to answer questions, the audience showed their interest by coming later
        to the booth asking for more details; not only about the platform and the infrastracture
        itself, but also about packaging generally. (...)</para>

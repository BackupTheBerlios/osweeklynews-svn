      </title>
      <para>The third <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE Conference</ulink> will occur on September 11-14, and there are only a few days left to submit a talk: the <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/">call for papers</ulink> is open until next Monday! So don&apos;t think twice, and go <ulink url="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2">submit</ulink> something now. If you really want to think twice, take a look at our <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Planning_2011_guidelines_for_speakers">guidelines for speakers</ulink>, they should convince it&apos;s worth the effort!</para>
      <para>There&apos;s a change this year: after thinking about how we could improve the conference, we decided that we wanted a stronger focus on smaller and interactive sessions. We describe this as &quot;read-write&quot;. But we also want to be ready to execute the results of those discussions, hence the &quot;execute&quot; bit. This is why we ended up with rwx, which might sound <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Symbolic_notation">familiar</ulink>. And since we want this for each of us, for our community and for the rest of the world, <emphasis role="bold">rwx³</emphasis> is our motto for this year. Yes, it&apos;s geeky, but hey, this is also part of our identity ;-)

</para>
      <para>Since I really like this change in focus for this year&apos;s conference, I decided that I would not submit a talk, but only <ulink url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/14/opensuse-conference-and-rw-sessions-the-bof/">BoFs</ulink> and <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Planning_2011_guidelines_for_speakers#Workshop">workshops</ulink>.

      <para>Based on the idea of <ulink url="http://maps.ubuntu.com/map/">http://maps.ubuntu.com/map/</ulink> my friend Efstathios and me
(mostly consulting) developed <ulink url="http://oshackers.org/">http://oshackers.org/</ulink> - A Web application that
can be used for visualizing the Free Software/Open Source operating system
hackers (developers / testers) around the world.</para>
      <para>oshackers supports features not included in the Ubuntu maps application, like
(1) clustering, (2) short/detailed information about a developer by simply
left-clicking on the system&apos;s icon, (3) visualization of a specific system, etc.</para>

      <para>My name is Manu, I am 21 years old and I live in India. I am currently in my final year of graduation in computer science. My native language is Hindi. During my free time, I participate in openSUSE Project and hang out with friends, watch movies and do other stuff.</para>

      <para>I started with computers in my 6th standard I believe starting with computer games. I immediately fell in love with them. But as I moved to boarding I had no access to computers until my college.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?</emphasis></para>
      <para>I started using openSUSE around 2 years back. I started to use it out of fascination and to learn about Linux as much as I can. Earlier I used Ubuntu and Fedora too but openSUSE caught my attention. I realized it to be a wonderful operating system that furnished my needs. (...)</para

      <para>As an openSUSE Ambassador, I 'm very happy toreport for another time what took place in
        the conference. </para>
      <para>So the conference lasted 1 day </para>
      <para>The Day : Booth and Presentation </para>
      <para>We set up the booth as an openSUSE Community. All the related stuff (about Medical and
        openSUSE) was available around the booth. Furthermore me and Stathis Iosifidis informed
        people about the openSUSE Project and openSUSE Medical Project as well as the applications
        which are available via the openSUSE Medical Distro. Efstathios Agrapidis also made an
        introductory presentation about OBS. The presentation rolled out smoothly. Although there
        wasn't enough time to answer questions, the audience showed their interest by coming later
        to the booth asking for more details; not only about the platform and the infrastracture
        itself, but also about packaging generally. (...)</para>

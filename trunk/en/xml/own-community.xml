        place).</para>

          Poortvlieet: And they keep rocking…</ulink></title>
    <para>Over the last few months the openSUSE ambassadors have continued to visit conferences
      around the world. Since our <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/06/opensuse-ambassadors-are-rocking-all-over-the-world/"
        >previous report</ulink> beginning of May, several big events have happened and we’ll treat
      you on a report on some of those.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Already covered in blogs</emphasis></para>
    <para>Let’s start with a few quick links to reports which are already online and probably read
      by some of you. There is for example the huge splash Greece ambassadors made at <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/27/fosscomm-2011/">Fosscomm 2011</ulink> which took
      place on May 7 and 8 in Greece. With 8 presentations as well as a similar number of lightning
      talks and a workshop on OBS openSUSE ruled the conference. The team co-hosted the GNOME
      community in their booth as well as the Enlightenment project and a few others, showing the
      open and collaborative spirit of openSUSE! Last but not least, they organized a late 11.4
      release party which ended up having Red Hat, Ubuntu, Slackware, FreeBSD and many other
      visitors joining the party!</para>
    <para>The Greek team also organized a <ulink
      url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/20/opensuse-summer-camp-greece-2011/">summer
      camp</ulink> from which you can see pictures in their <ulink
        url="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=153638841330360">facebook group</ulink>. Rest
      assured we’ll make them work harder after they so clearly spend a lot of time drinking and
      hanging in the sun…</para>
    <para>Most interestingly, the Greek team went to <ulink
      url="http://zoumpis.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/participation-of-opensuse-greek-community-in-xariseto-gr-bazaar-may-14-2011-report/"
      >the Xariseto.gr bazaar</ulink>. In Thanasis’ words: Xariseto is a festival where people
      meet and donate their personal belongings which they don’t use any more. So as a Linux and
      openSUSE community we thought that participating in these kind of festivals is really
      interesting.</para>
    <para>The result was people from 7 to 70 years old learning about openSUSE… The team also went
      to the <ulink
        url="http://opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/06/report-from-ellak-conference.html"
        >EL/LAK conference in Thessaloniki</ulink>.</para>
    <para>And as was quite visible on <ulink url="http://planet.opensuse.org/">planet

                  >Berlin</ulink>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">More reports</emphasis></para>
    <para>While not all openSUSE ambassadors have the time to send in event reports, we are always
      happy to read the ones we get. Below a few of them.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Chile, FLISoL</emphasis></para>
    <para>At the end of April, Ricardo Varas Santana attended the FLISoL event in Chile, which has
      about 1000 visitors. He gave a talk titled <emphasis role="italic">“openSUSE, Linux in Green
        and for all”</emphasis>, talking about what openSUSE is, how to get involved as well as what
      technologies we have. About 400 DVD’s were handed out as well!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">USA</emphasis></para>
    <para>Orv Beach participated in the Southwest Computer Conference where he presented openSUSE to
      an eager crowd. He gave out Tuxes and Geeko’s as well as 160 DVD’s and flyers to the visitors,
      mostly members from Computer Clubs around the USA.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Taiwan</emphasis></para>
    <para>Max “Sakana” from Taiwan wrote us three reports in one. First of all, he as well as
      several other openSUSE ambassadors was at GNOME.Asia 2011, where the GNOME 3 LiveDVD’s (based
      on openSUSE) were handed out. Pictures can be found in the<ulink
        url="http://www.flickr.com/groups/opensuse/pool/page2/">openSUSE flickr pool</ulink>. But
      Max and the Taiwan team did more. Max teaches students openSUSE at the <ulink
        url="http://english.mcut.edu.tw/onweb.jsp?webno=3333333330">Ming Chi University of
        Technology</ulink>, where openSUSE is quite popular. Moreover, there were two seminars at
      two different colleges, the <ulink url="http://webov.ltu.edu.tw/Eng_Ltu/">Ling Tung
        University</ulink> and the <ulink url="http://www.nfu.edu.tw/main.php">National Formosa
          University</ulink> about <ulink url="http://susestudio.com/">SUSE Studio</ulink> and Nagios
      with openSUSE. openSUSE DVD’s were handed out and according to Max, openSUSE did very
      well!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Great Britain</emphasis></para>
    <para>Stuart Tanner went to the RedRat Computer Market in Sheffield. He was the only linux
      person in the room and brought a large 42″ FullHD TV to demo it. He tried to lure
      amateur-photographers into Free Software, aweing them with ShowFoto, DigiKam and similar
      tools</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Netherlands</emphasis></para>
    <para>Your humble writer has also done his small share the last months, showing up at a computer
      event in the Netherlands. A team of 4 manned a booth, held 2 presentations, handed out a few
      hundred DVD’s as well as posters and in general showed openSUSE rocks also in NL!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">more work</emphasis></para>
    <para>First of all, the above are just a few of the events we know about. For example, in
      Brazil, openSUSE was present on FISL, the Porto Alegre event with over 8000 visitors. We’re
      eagerly awaiting the event report! More events happened, more will come. But this is not the
      only thing openSUSE ambassadors do!</para>
    <para>Take the incredible Baltasar Ortega who has been covering openSUSE and KDE
      technology <ulink url="http://kdeblog.com/">in his blog</ulink> for years! If you can read
      Spanish, be sure to bookmark his blog. He will point you to<ulink
        url="http://www.kdeblog.com/como-grabar-tu-live-usb-con-imagewriter.html">gems like the
        Studio Imagewriter</ulink> or share <ulink
          url="http://www.kdeblog.com/kde-tutorials-7-y-8-cambiando-las-fuentes-y-uso-basico-de-dolphin.html"
          >wonderful tutorials like these</ulink>. Max wrote an article about <emphasis role="italic"
            >“openSUSE and Hadoop”</emphasis> the May edition of the Hongkong Chinese/Taiwanese <ulink
              url="http://www.linuxpilot.com/issue/102">Linux Pilot Magazine</ulink>.</para>
    <para>And did you notice our Greek team <ulink
      url="http://opensuseambassadors.blogspot.com/2011/07/greek-opensuse-community-translation-of_15.html"
      >translates the awesome Weekly News in Greece</ulink>?</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Value</emphasis></para>
    <para>The work these ambassadors do for openSUSE is incredibly valuable and should not be under
      estimated. Christos Bountalis, working on <ulink
        url="http://cbounta.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/gsoc-2011tool-for-merging-configuration-files/"
        >fillup-ng</ulink> in openSUSE, joined after meeting the Greek openSUSE ambassadors at an
      event, remarking <ulink
        url="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/23/people-of-opensuse-christos-bountalis/">in his
        interview</ulink>, when asked why he joined openSUSE: I have found many nice and interesting
      peopleAnd indeed. People are what makes the difference between a good and a great Free
      Software project. And our Ambassadors are often the first people outsiders see!</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Thanks!</emphasis></para>
    <para>So we’d like to thank our ambassadors for their awesome work, and invite anyone to <ulink
      url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Ambassadors">join their ranks</ulink>!</para>
    <para>You can also help in other ways. For example, if you are an openSUSE developer or follow
      development closely, add a glimpse of what is coming to the wiki. Or if you know a bit about
      openSUSE, add and improve our talking points! We also can always use artwork, help with
      writing and many other things. Feel free to contact the openSUSE marketing team
      on opensuse-marketing@opensuse.org and offer to help out!</para>

      <para>From Friday the 15th to Sunday the 17th of July Lizards and other FOSS enthusiasts were
        gathered at Katerini for the 1st Greek openSUSE Collaboration Summer weekend Camp.</para>
      <para>The whole event started at the Hotel pool where all met before the actual beginning of the
        event . After everybody that was expected came, the talks started.</para>
      <para>Fridays talks were more related to the openSUSE local community.&#160;<ulink url="http://stathisuse.blogspot.com/">Efstathios Iosifidis</ulink>&#160;and&#160;<ulink url="http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/">Kostas Koudaras</ulink>presented&#160;<ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">Lokalize</ulink>&#160;and&#160;<ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/">gtranslator</ulink>&#160;and show people how useful
        tool those are. Efstathios Agrapidis along with<ulink url="http://en-gb.facebook.com/differentreality">Stella Rouzi</ulink>&#160;presented how you can
        help the community by translating the openSUSE weekly news.</para>
      <para>After a dinner break from 19:30 to 20:30 there was a Translation contest. The original
        plans were on letting people translating some wiki articles in a certain time but since people
        were enthusiast about&#160;<ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">Lokalize</ulink>&#160;and<ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/">gtranslator</ulink>&#160;the program Committee&#160;
        decided to change it and give people .po files to translate. The contest should normally last
        one and a half hour total but everybody asked for more time to do more work, so&#160;&#160;&#160;<ulink url="http://anadiotisd.wordpress.com/">Diomidis Anadiotis</ulink>&#160;talk ‘I am new to the
        community’ was postponed and the contest lasted until midnight. During the contest 20
        applications were translated from English to Greece.</para>
      <para>The program was made lose so that people had the opportunity to physically collaborate, it
        was considered more important for the people to have fun working as a community than actually
        have a tight schedule and this actually worked perfect through the weekend. After all the hard
        work of the first day, people wore their bathing-suits and went to the Hotel’s pool party
        where they had tons of fun. People there had&#160; beers, conversations about FOSS, late night pool
        games. The last of them actually left the party after 4:00. Once again it was proven that FOSS
        is tightly connected with fun.</para>
      <para>At Saturday there was an early wake around 8:30 for breakfast and around 10:15 the program
        started with the announcement of the previous night’s contest where&#160;<ulink url="http://anadiotisd.wordpress.com/">Diomidis Anadiotis</ulink>&#160;won the Geeko plush
        reward. The First presentation of the day was ‘Using Yast – System management: easy, fast and
        with many options’ where Efstatios Agrapidis and&#160;<ulink url="http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/">Kostas Koudaras</ulink>&#160;presented how and why to use YaST more.&#160;&#160;&#160; The day continued
        with&#160;<ulink url="http://blogs.gentoo.org/tampakrap/">Theo Chatzimichos</ulink>from
        the&#160;<ulink url="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</ulink>&#160;community presenting Django and
        making a tutorial of how and why to use it. After that<ulink url="http://www.itsystem.gr/">Stavros Kalapothas</ulink>&#160;and&#160;<ulink url="http://efxa.org/">Efstathios Hatzikiriakidis</ulink>&#160;from<ulink url="http://the-hackerspace.org/">The-Hackerspace</ulink>&#160;presented ‘Security and arduino: Multifactor authentication system
        (voice recognition and RFID technologies)’ which was a four hour workshop with a short
        break.</para>
      <para>After the workshop, at around 15:00 there was&#160; long break where once again there were
        great&#160; FOSS conversations among cold beer, water-gun fights, pool volley and other water
        sports… Some people though preferred to take a nap since last nights sleep was not enough for
        them.</para>
      <para>At around 17:30 the program started again with ‘Qt Signals And Slots’ from Antonis
        Tsapaliokas from<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</ulink>&#160;and continued with another
        workshop from the people of&#160;<ulink url="http://the-hackerspace.org/">The-Hackerspace</ulink>&#160;titled ‘Security and arduino: Wireless devices remote control (client
        – server control center)’. There was a dinner break and then continued with a ‘Vim
        introduction’ by&#160;<ulink url="http://y.chatz.gr/blog">Yannis Chatzimichos</ulink>&#160;which was
        really interesting and showed people why Vim is better than other editors. After that there
        was the previous days scheduled talk from Diomidis Anidiotis titled ‘I’m new in the community’
        where he talked about how new people to a FOSS community feel entering a community. It was a
        great feedback for all and this lead to the next and last planned conversation for the day
        which was ‘Collaborating inside a FOSS community’, where all people expressed their opinion
        about how people should do that. Many valuable conclusions were made there. Of course once
        again people went to the pool-bar afterward and continued the conversation there.</para>
      <para>Sunday was the last day and it started around 10:00 after breakfast with the Gnome
        community and<ulink url="http://stathisuse.blogspot.com/">Efstathios Iosifidis</ulink>&#160;presenting ‘Surviving with Gnome 3 in a KDE-world’. Efstathios Agrapidis
        took up the baton presenting ‘I’m OBS-ing, are you OBS-ing too?’. Unfortunately there were
        some internet issues so instead of the OBS workshop, after the OBS presentation we had&#160;<ulink url="http://blogs.gentoo.org/tampakrap/">Theo Chatzimichos</ulink>&#160;(due to popular demand)
        continuing the workshop on Django. After that came George Tsapaliokas presenting ‘KDE
        Frameworks’ and how to work with them. The day finished with a talk from&#160;<ulink url="http://zoumpis.wordpress.com/">Athanasios-Ilias Rousinopoulos</ulink>&#160;titled ‘openSUSE

      <para>The new openSUSE 12.1 Release is approaching very soon and all you Geekos should not miss
        the opportunity of becoming a <emphasis role="italic">double GPM</emphasis>!</para>
      <para>Party time starts this weekend and lasts until November 2011 in all Geeko-towns and
        Geeko-homes. Gather all your fellow Geekos to the best local pizzeria and let the party
        begin!</para>

            bit</ulink> but party can still be had – the release will be this weekend. Of course,
        instead, you can organize a launch party for 12.1 once it is out – which is currently planned
        the third week of November. (...)</para>

      <para>From Friday the 15th to Sunday the 17th of July Lizards and other FOSS enthusiasts were
        gathered at Katerini for the 1st Greek openSUSE Collaboration Summer weekend Camp.</para>
      <para>The whole event started at the Hotel pool where all met before the actual beginning of the
        event . After everybody that was expected came, the talks started.</para>
      <para>Fridays talks were more related to the openSUSE local community.&#160;<ulink url="http://stathisuse.blogspot.com/">Efstathios Iosifidis</ulink>&#160;and&#160;<ulink url="http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/">Kostas Koudaras</ulink>presented&#160;<ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">Lokalize</ulink>&#160;and&#160;<ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/">gtranslator</ulink>&#160;and show people how useful
        tool those are. Efstathios Agrapidis along with<ulink url="http://en-gb.facebook.com/differentreality">Stella Rouzi</ulink>&#160;presented how you can
        help the community by translating the openSUSE weekly news.</para>
      <para>After a dinner break from 19:30 to 20:30 there was a Translation contest. The original
        plans were on letting people translating some wiki articles in a certain time but since people
        were enthusiast about&#160;<ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">Lokalize</ulink>&#160;and<ulink url="http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/">gtranslator</ulink>&#160;the program Committee&#160;
        decided to change it and give people .po files to translate. The contest should normally last
        one and a half hour total but everybody asked for more time to do more work, so&#160;&#160;&#160;<ulink url="http://anadiotisd.wordpress.com/">Diomidis Anadiotis</ulink>&#160;talk ‘I am new to the
        community’ was postponed and the contest lasted until midnight. During the contest 20
        applications were translated from English to Greece.</para>
      <para>The program was made lose so that people had the opportunity to physically collaborate, it
        was considered more important for the people to have fun working as a community than actually
        have a tight schedule and this actually worked perfect through the weekend. After all the hard
        work of the first day, people wore their bathing-suits and went to the Hotel’s pool party
        where they had tons of fun. People there had&#160; beers, conversations about FOSS, late night pool
        games. The last of them actually left the party after 4:00. Once again it was proven that FOSS
        is tightly connected with fun.</para>
      <para>At Saturday there was an early wake around 8:30 for breakfast and around 10:15 the program
        started with the announcement of the previous night’s contest where&#160;<ulink url="http://anadiotisd.wordpress.com/">Diomidis Anadiotis</ulink>&#160;won the Geeko plush
        reward. The First presentation of the day was ‘Using Yast – System management: easy, fast and
        with many options’ where Efstatios Agrapidis and&#160;<ulink url="http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/">Kostas Koudaras</ulink>&#160;presented how and why to use YaST more.&#160;&#160;&#160; The day continued
        with&#160;<ulink url="http://blogs.gentoo.org/tampakrap/">Theo Chatzimichos</ulink>from
        the&#160;<ulink url="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</ulink>&#160;community presenting Django and
        making a tutorial of how and why to use it. After that<ulink url="http://www.itsystem.gr/">Stavros Kalapothas</ulink>&#160;and&#160;<ulink url="http://efxa.org/">Efstathios Hatzikiriakidis</ulink>&#160;from<ulink url="http://the-hackerspace.org/">The-Hackerspace</ulink>&#160;presented ‘Security and arduino: Multifactor authentication system
        (voice recognition and RFID technologies)’ which was a four hour workshop with a short
        break.</para>
      <para>After the workshop, at around 15:00 there was&#160; long break where once again there were
        great&#160; FOSS conversations among cold beer, water-gun fights, pool volley and other water
        sports… Some people though preferred to take a nap since last nights sleep was not enough for
        them.</para>
      <para>At around 17:30 the program started again with ‘Qt Signals And Slots’ from Antonis
        Tsapaliokas from<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</ulink>&#160;and continued with another
        workshop from the people of&#160;<ulink url="http://the-hackerspace.org/">The-Hackerspace</ulink>&#160;titled ‘Security and arduino: Wireless devices remote control (client
        – server control center)’. There was a dinner break and then continued with a ‘Vim
        introduction’ by&#160;<ulink url="http://y.chatz.gr/blog">Yannis Chatzimichos</ulink>&#160;which was
        really interesting and showed people why Vim is better than other editors. After that there
        was the previous days scheduled talk from Diomidis Anidiotis titled ‘I’m new in the community’
        where he talked about how new people to a FOSS community feel entering a community. It was a
        great feedback for all and this lead to the next and last planned conversation for the day
        which was ‘Collaborating inside a FOSS community’, where all people expressed their opinion
        about how people should do that. Many valuable conclusions were made there. Of course once
        again people went to the pool-bar afterward and continued the conversation there.</para>
      <para>Sunday was the last day and it started around 10:00 after breakfast with the Gnome
        community and<ulink url="http://stathisuse.blogspot.com/">Efstathios Iosifidis</ulink>&#160;presenting ‘Surviving with Gnome 3 in a KDE-world’. Efstathios Agrapidis
        took up the baton presenting ‘I’m OBS-ing, are you OBS-ing too?’. Unfortunately there were
        some internet issues so instead of the OBS workshop, after the OBS presentation we had&#160;<ulink url="http://blogs.gentoo.org/tampakrap/">Theo Chatzimichos</ulink>&#160;(due to popular demand)
        continuing the workshop on Django. After that came George Tsapaliokas presenting ‘KDE
        Frameworks’ and how to work with them. The day finished with a talk from&#160;<ulink url="http://zoumpis.wordpress.com/">Athanasios-Ilias Rousinopoulos</ulink>&#160;titled ‘openSUSE
        Medical project’ where as the new project leader he talked to us about it and why we should
        all help this project.</para>
      <para>As you can see from the photos, the event was a success as it reached its goal providing
        education through presentations, workshops and discussions, all that through summer
        entertainment.</para>
      <para>Most important, all participants are impatiently looking forward to the next event! Soon
        the videos of the workshops and talks will be available at&#160;<ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv">YouTube</ulink>, stay tuned…</para>
      <para>Special Thanks to Giorgos Tsapaliokas and&#160;<ulink url="http://en-gb.facebook.com/differentreality">Stella Rouzi</ulink>&#160;for helping more from
        all on organizing the whole event. Also the Greek openSUSE community really wants to thank the
        people from&#160;<ulink url="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</ulink>,&#160;<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</ulink>,&#160;<ulink url="http://the-hackerspace.org/">The-Hackerspace</ulink>&#160;and<ulink url="http://y.chatz.gr/blog">Yannis Chatzimichos</ulink>&#160;for participating at the event with their valuable and really interesting
        presentations and workshops.</para>

      <para>As I mentioned in my <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/catch-me-scale">previous
          post</ulink>, I am at the Southern California Linux Expo in Los Angeles this weekend. What
        I failed to mention in my previous post was <emphasis role="bold">massive showing</emphasis>
        from the openSUSE community at the exposition.</para>
      <para>Throughout the day the openSUSE team was <emphasis role="bold">extremeley</emphasis>
        busy introducing a myriad of different people to openSUSE and SUSE Studio at the openSUSE
        booth.</para>

      <para>Outside of the expo show floor, the team <xref linkend="fig.team"/> was also running
          "<ulink url="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/special-events/opensuse-day">openSUSE
          Day</ulink>", taking the opportunity to run a few classroom-styled events on topics like:
        using YaST, building packages with the <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/">OBS</ulink>
        and using SUSE Studio like a pro.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">At the booth</emphasis></para>
      <para>I found myself manning the booth the majority of the day, giving me an opportunity to
        talk with plenty of folks about one of my favorite topics: openSUSE. Due the large number of
        Geekos (openSUSE folk) at the conference and the <emphasis role="bold">giant</emphasis>
        beacon of green coming from the booth, interested people clustered around the booth for most
        of the day asking <emphasis role="italic"/>plenty of questions.</para>
      <para>I wish I could say that everybody was there because they were genuinely curious about
        openSUSE, but that's not entirely true. As soon as word spread about the cute <ulink
          url="http://www.flickr.com/photos/omgsuse/5477367803/in/set-72157626140989222/">Tux and
          Geeko plushes</ulink> that Novell had provided the team, people started dropping by asking
        how they could get their hands on those adorable little animals.</para>
      <para>Overall, the reactions and responses to openSUSE I got from Linux users were very
        positive. It <emphasis role="italic">seems</emphasis> that lots of folks out there in the
        Linux world are apprehensive about the direction Ubuntu is heading in current, and are
        starting to explore other options for easy-to-use and solid distros like openSUSE.

      <title><ulink url="http://www.bryen.com/opensuse-11-4-arrives-in-san-diego/">openSUSE 11.4 Arrives in San Diego</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>The latest release of openSUSE 11.4 on Thursday proved to be a very good release day for us around the world.  And in celebrating the release day, several of us came to visit San Diego’s Kernel Panic Linux User Group (<ulink url="http://www.kernel-panic.org/">KPLUG</ulink>). It was a good crowd at the event with the members of KPLUG and friends some of us invited to join the festivities and learn about openSUSE.</para>
      <para>Representing openSUSE were local openSUSE guru Tony Su, Brazilian Ambassadors Carlos Ribeiro and Izabel Valverde (In town for the recent SCALE and openSUSE Marketing Hackfest in Los Angeles) and myself.</para>

      <para>As most people present weren’t users of openSUSE, we decided to focus our message not just on what is so cool and awesome about openSUSE, but rather on how openSUSE complements the Project itself.  I started out by giving a brief overview of what openSUSE represents as a Project and the various things we do in the Project.  Tony then continued by giving a live demonstration of KDE and then moved on to an in-depth look at YaST. Occasionally, Carlos also offered useful information about the various features of openSUSE and even helped out with a couple of users after the presentation.</para>

      <para>A lot of good questions were generated by the audience, and we saw questions focusing on our OBS ervice, SUSE Studio and virtualization.  Additionally, people asked questions about the Project itself and how it is sponsored.  I think people were generally impressed to learn and understand that our openSUSE Project is truly a community-driven project and that our relationship with our sponsors are collaborative rather than managed.</para>
      <para>Afterwards, in the grand tradition of openSUSE Launch Parties, we gave out cake and DVDs as well as a bunch of stickers.  As I kept near the DVDs to answer questions, I was genuinely pleased to see people not only took DVDs for themselves, but asked if they could also take extra copies to give to their friends.</para>

      <para>I have to say that the KPLUG folks were truly a nice group of people, and their backgrounds truly very interesting, ranging from systems administrators to piano teacher to retiree who can’t quite give up his love for Linux.  It was also a pleasure to meet with Neil, the president of KPLUG.</para>
      <para>Cake was definitely delish.  I only wish I had extra days in San Diego before the KPLUG event so I could have ordered a proper openSUSE photo cake with logo and all.  But, once it gets in your stomach, I guess it really doesn’t matter.  :-)</para>
      <para>Hope to have a chance to visit the guys at KPLUG again, the next time I visit San Diego.  If you live in the San Diego area, check them out.  Next month, they’re doing a presentation of MythTV.  Should be very interesting!</para>
      <para>Next stop, representnin’ GNOME Foundation Accessibility at the CSUN Assistive Technology conference in San Diego this week.   I’ll update you all on what happens there.</para>

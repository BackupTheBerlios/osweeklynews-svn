          >Bruno Friedmann: Gnome3 launch party @ Zürich report</ulink></title>
      <para>A group of 20 people met in ETHZ F26.3 room Friday afternoon (3pm to 7pm). To assist the
        Gnome 3 Launch party. We were expecting more people, but a so sunny weather, and a Monday
        off in Zýrich doesn’t help to keep people inside after a long winter. <inlinemediaobject>

      <para>Marcus Moeller showed us a deep overview of the whole Gnome 3 desktop, with the strength
        and weakness (non yet finished features or controversial ones).</para>
      <para>Then there’s some talks about features, what will happen unity/ubuntu/gnome etc …</para>

      <title><ulink url="http://www.bryen.com/opensuse-11-4-arrives-in-san-diego/">openSUSE 11.4 Arrives in San Diego</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>The latest release of openSUSE 11.4 on Thursday proved to be a very good release day for
        us around the world. And in celebrating the release day, several of us came to visit San
        Diego’s Kernel Panic Linux User Group (<ulink url="http://www.kernel-panic.org/"
          >KPLUG</ulink>). It was a good crowd at the event with the members of KPLUG and friends
        some of us invited to join the festivities and learn about openSUSE.</para>
      <para>Representing openSUSE were local openSUSE guru Tony Su, Brazilian Ambassadors Carlos
        Ribeiro and Izabel Valverde (In town for the recent SCALE and openSUSE Marketing Hackfest in
        Los Angeles) and myself.</para>

      <para>As most people present weren’t users of openSUSE, we decided to focus our message not
        just on what is so cool and awesome about openSUSE, but rather on how openSUSE complements
        the Project itself. I started out by giving a brief overview of what openSUSE represents as
        a Project and the various things we do in the Project. Tony then continued by giving a live
        demonstration of KDE and then moved on to an in-depth look at YaST. Occasionally, Carlos
        also offered useful information about the various features of openSUSE and even helped out
        with a couple of users after the presentation.</para>

            />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>A lot of good questions were generated by the audience, and we saw questions focusing on
        our OBS ervice, SUSE Studio and virtualization. Additionally, people asked questions about
        the Project itself and how it is sponsored. I think people were generally impressed to learn
        and understand that our openSUSE Project is truly a community-driven project and that our
        relationship with our sponsors are collaborative rather than managed.</para>
      <para>Afterwards, in the grand tradition of openSUSE Launch Parties, we gave out cake and DVDs
        as well as a bunch of stickers. As I kept near the DVDs to answer questions, I was genuinely
        pleased to see people not only took DVDs for themselves, but asked if they could also take
        extra copies to give to their friends.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>I have to say that the KPLUG folks were truly a nice group of people, and their
        backgrounds truly very interesting, ranging from systems administrators to piano teacher to
        retiree who can’t quite give up his love for Linux. It was also a pleasure to meet with
        Neil, the president of KPLUG.</para>
      <para>Cake was definitely delish. I only wish I had extra days in San Diego before the KPLUG
        event so I could have ordered a proper openSUSE photo cake with logo and all. But, once it
        gets in your stomach, I guess it really doesn’t matter. :-)</para>
      <para>Hope to have a chance to visit the guys at KPLUG again, the next time I visit San Diego.
        If you live in the San Diego area, check them out. Next month, they’re doing a presentation
        of MythTV. Should be very interesting!</para>
      <para>Next stop, representnin’ GNOME Foundation Accessibility at the CSUN Assistive Technology
        conference in San Diego this week. I’ll update you all on what happens there.</para>

      <para>We had all kind of freebies for the people to take. We had some serious party equipment
        like balloons and whistles. Of course we also had 11.3 DVD with instructions stickers for
        upgrade on. Also we burned a few 11.4 and we had stickers, openSUSE cheat-cubes, openSUSE
        Calendars and various other openSUSE stuff.</para>

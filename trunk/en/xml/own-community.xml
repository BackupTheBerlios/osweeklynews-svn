      <para>Some of you crazy minds must have guessed from the topic and to the rest I’ll explain ;)
        . Yes , this is regard to the latest <ulink url="http://wiki.opensuse.org/Portal:Teams"
        />Team categorization process in the new Wiki instance . For the past few days myself along
        with rest of the community members ( P.M for a list :) ) have been working on this process
        and finally came up with something presentable . I know this is not 100% yet , so we require
        your suggestions and ideas. If you have something to say leave a comment or directly can
        contact me . By end of this week I plan to announce the page officially so send me your
        views quick . But I can be flexible on this , that said I am in no hurry.</para>

      <para>Yesterday a small team of the Greek openSUSE community decided to go on a Christmas roadtrip. We traveled about 2 and a half hours to go to the beautiful border 
        town of Florina. We were invited by teachers of The Educational Computer Association of Florina to help them promote FOSS. In the central square of the city they 
        hard wooden houses with different themes (you can see the pictures). openSUSE Greek team with KLUG and a very active elementary teacher, Mr Ioannis Kaskamanidis, 
        were informing people who was interested in what we do. Mr Kaskamanidis, brought his students with their XO laptops. Kids were showing their laptops with pride 
        and giving away info packs (PromoDVDs, stickers, brochures). We also met with a local doctor, Dr Evangelos Tsoukas. He translated and supports the Electronic 
        Medical Records program called openEMR.</para>
      <para>openSUSE team was pretty happy about promoting our distro to citizens of Florina. We didn't mind that we drove 200km to reach the city or the soft rain that made 
      us to put all our equipment inside the wooden house. What is left from this event was:</para>

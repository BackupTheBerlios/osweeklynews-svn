      <para>Last week I was at LinuxTag in Berlin. It was a great event. This time it was my second
        year there. I really enjoyed the first year and so I did this time as well. I spoke to many
        people, learned new interesting stuff and my todo list got again somehow longer <mediaobject>

        </mediaobject> And I believe that I also showed some interesting stuff to the people at our
        booth. I was speaking about GNOME Shell to anybody who happened to be nearby and everybody
        liked it! Good work, GNOME guys! I’m glad I was able to be there and I want to share few
        pictures from the event with you, so even if you couldn’t make it there, you’ll see at least
        a little bit of what we were doing. We had a lot of fun <mediaobject>

      <para>Last week openSUSE had 30 Geekos at LinuxTag in Berlin. Awesome times, with the
        exception of the last day when we figured out the power supplies of our nice big
        touchscreens were stolen... And to think the thieves left the beamer?!?</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Talks</emphasis></para>
      <para>But aside that little snag, we rocked. At the booth we had mini-presentations, which
        weren&apos;t as successful as last year, but the 15 presentations we gave in the big rooms worked
        out just fine. Of course, Vincent Untz had to give his cross-distribution ollaboration talk
        as first presentation on the day after the party and my own openSUSE 11.4 intro was
        scheduled at the same time as fellow Geeko Eckhart&apos;s talk about Wayland. </para>

      <para>Still, I&apos;m quite sure we got the word out on openSUSE. Especially when it comes to
        &apos;openSUSE is more than a distro&apos;. Personally, I feel more and more strongly on that subject.
        Presenting openSUSE 11.4 is nice - we&apos;ve got some interesting things there, but honestly -
        what is really so special about the specific kernel or LibreOffice version we ship? I feel a
        lot happier telling people about <ulink url="http://opensuse.org/Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</ulink> or <ulink url="http://build.opensuse.org">OBS</ulink>! (...)</para>

    </title>
    <para>I was traveling last week to attend two events: Solutions Linux in Paris and LinuxTag in
      Berlin. It was a bit unfortunate that they happened during the same week, as they conflicted
      for two days — which means I missed some days for both events. And on top of that, the
      Ubuntu Developer Summit was also last week, which resulted in some people missing the
      events... </para>
    <para>Compared to last year, both events had a quite visible difference in terms of number of
      visitors. I&apos;m not exactly sure why this is so; it could be because there were conflicts with
      other events, or also because they moved to first half of May, which is different from
      previous years. </para>
    <para>What was most amazing, however, was to be present at booths just one month after the
      GNOME 3.0 release. For both events, we had tons of GNOME 3 PromoDVDs (kindly offered on
      behalf of the openSUSE project) to give away, and that was a big success: I think we gave
      around 600 of them at Solutions Linux and probably a similar amount, if not more, at
      LinuxTag (Tobias would know better than me here).</para>

      to meet, be available at our booth for questions and take part at the talks. With over 10.000
      attendees it’s the biggest event of this kind, and you can be sure to always meet some well
      known faces of the openSUSE community there.</para>
    <para>On the technical side, there were some interesting talks about virtualization,
      cross-distribution, kernel and the usage of free software in business environments just to
      give a few examples. (...)</para>

        super-nice as a way to <emphasis role="bold">distribute</emphasis> content. The
        presentations are up to 25 mb, which you can&apos;t download from gitorious directly... Luckily,
        Bruno &quot;Tigerfoot&quot; Friedman has set up a nice mirror where you can download the
        presentations. </para>

      <para>These days the Greek openSUSE community took over most of my time since some of the hard
        working members are University students and it is examination season here in Greece and so I
        had to give them less or no work at all and someone should replace them so that no community
        work will fall back. For this week we made it and we still hold on as planned. We just
        released the <ulink url="http://el.opensuse.org/Weekly_news">Greek edition of Weekly
          news</ulink>. Unfortunately I feel I left back a bit my work at the marketing team but I
        will catch up ;-) . ...But on the other hand this week I had the opportunity to start
        writing a Greek article about <ulink
          url="http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2011/01/03/opensuse-project-evergreen/">Project
          Evergreen</ulink> that got my attention and I had some ideas about we can promote it. I
        got in touch with <ulink url="http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/">Wolfgang Rosenauer</ulink>
        about it so that I can take his personal opinion and some directions about it and with
        Stratos Zolotas from the Greek Community that makes some bug-testing in 2 desktops and a
        server for the Evergreen project. It is a really interesting project and is another thing
        that shows the free will of the people in the openSUSE community to create and develop their
        own community projects. That last goes to those who believe that the openSUSE community is a
        corporate slave... </para>
      <para>Another thing I made this week is becoming an even more active openSUSE contributor by
        entering the Greek Localization team and even making a <ulink
          url="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS account</ulink>. To be honest with you this was
        not my original intention for now but it came up due to my will to translate the <ulink
          url="http://doc.opensuse.org/products/other/WebYaST/webyast-user/">WebYaST</ulink> user
        manual. I am really excited with that work because is far more exciting than I was
        expecting. Of course I still have some difficulties but it is like a new toy for me and I
        spend a lot of my time with it the past 2 days. </para>
      <para>I also joined the <ulink url="https://connect.opensuse.org/">openSUSE connect</ulink> .
        I am from those few people that don't like Facebook, that is why I have no account there and
        as Stathis told me this is the 'Lizard Facebook' without the farm game and all the other
        annoying applications. Well I thing I liked it... I am now try to find ways to make it a
        useful tool so that we will start being productive and creative with it. I would suggest to
        all of you to give it a look. </para>
      <para>Other than that there are the elections part... I found out many things about people
        through all that procedure. I got the idea that many people thought that I would give up
        everything I do in order to support my campaign. I hope I prove all of them wrong.
        Understand that nothing in life will change dramatically after the elections are over. As I
        said many times before, I prefer acting more than everything else and my positions are
        written in <ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2010_platform_warlordfff">my election
          platform</ulink>. Sometimes doing nothing is also an action.</para>

      <para>Yesterday a small team of the Greek openSUSE community decided to go on a Christmas
        roadtrip. We traveled about 2 and a half hours to go to the beautiful border town of
        Florina. We were invited by teachers of The Educational Computer Association of Florina to
        help them promote FOSS. In the central square of the city they hard wooden houses with
        different themes (you can see the pictures). openSUSE Greek team with KLUG and a very active
        elementary teacher, Mr Ioannis Kaskamanidis, were informing people who was interested in
        what we do. Mr Kaskamanidis, brought his students with their XO laptops. Kids were showing
        their laptops with pride and giving away info packs (PromoDVDs, stickers, brochures). We
        also met with a local doctor, Dr Evangelos Tsoukas. He translated and supports the
        Electronic Medical Records program called openEMR.</para>
      <para>openSUSE team was pretty happy about promoting our distro to citizens of Florina. We
        didn't mind that we drove 200km to reach the city or the soft rain that made us to put all
        our equipment inside the wooden house. What is left from this event was:</para>

      <para>This meeting supported by the openSUSE community, gathered people from different levels

        interested in using FLOSS (a.k.a. newbies), students who are <quote>candidates</quote> to
        join the Kokoa community, the current <quote>active</quote> members and the experienced
          <quote>senior</quote> members.</para>
      <para>In this event different topics were discussed covering FLOSS usage in the academia and
        the industry. Stories of success and guidelines were shared with people interested in going
        forward in the world of FLOSS.</para>
      <para>Special thanks to Cristina Guerrero, Nervo Verdezoto, Marisol Villacrés, and from
        Jarflex, Adonis Figueroa and Jessica Zuñiga the speakers of this meeting and specially to

      <para>On December 28-29-30, 2010, we joined the calling from our friends from the web page
        xariseto.gr. They had a bazaar in Hortiatis, Thessaloniki (Greece). The place was far from
        our city but it was near for some people that live there.</para>
      <para>Many people were bringing items they didn't need, but can be used by someone else that
        need them. You can see on the last picture <xref linkend="fig.greek2"/> what it was all
        about. We were there to inform people about FOSS and openSUSE. We had a lot of people asking
        questions about it. Mostly they didn't know that there's something different than windows.
        We hope we made a difference even to 1 person.</para>

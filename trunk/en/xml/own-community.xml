      <para>2011 Finally came, I wish you all a healthy overall year although this new years dawn
        found me ill with a cold and fever, as a result of recklessly insisting on riding a
        motorcycle at -2 C. From the start I sense that this year will be a hard working one. 3 days
        ago I opened my eyes from fever and I found last years jobs awaiting. I lost the deadline I
        gave to my self for releasing the openSUSE Weekly news. I didn't shared the articles for
        translation to the people and I had left my candidacy for the board without a candidate
        amongst other things that I had to do. I was in panic for about 2 seconds, I confess that no
        matter what I do I hate not completing the jobs I took over. Two seconds later I tried to
        concentrate, I chilled out and let things role. Thank God I have good people around me
        helping me, so I finished all the works around the Greek community, I even found the time to
        organize some new things like a very interesting event that we will announce in the next few
        days.</para>
      <para>Other than that I made some work with my candidacy, I prepared my <ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2010_platform_warlordfff">Board
          election platform</ulink> and started make some planning for my campaign. I still have
        lots of hard work to do. The other candidates are really interesting people and all of them
        have contributed a lot to the project. It is going to be a hard race and this is good
        because it will be interesting to the end. I believe that no matter the results, <emphasis
          role="bold">openSUSE community will be the final winner</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Yesterday a small team of the Greek openSUSE community decided to go on a Christmas
        roadtrip. We traveled about 2 and a half hours to go to the beautiful border town of
        Florina. We were invited by teachers of The Educational Computer Association of Florina to
        help them promote FOSS. In the central square of the city they hard wooden houses with
        different themes (you can see the pictures). openSUSE Greek team with KLUG and a very active
        elementary teacher, Mr Ioannis Kaskamanidis, were informing people who was interested in
        what we do. Mr Kaskamanidis, brought his students with their XO laptops. Kids were showing
        their laptops with pride and giving away info packs (PromoDVDs, stickers, brochures). We
        also met with a local doctor, Dr Evangelos Tsoukas. He translated and supports the
        Electronic Medical Records program called openEMR.</para>
      <para>openSUSE team was pretty happy about promoting our distro to citizens of Florina. We
        didn't mind that we drove 200km to reach the city or the soft rain that made us to put all
        our equipment inside the wooden house. What is left from this event was:</para>

      <para>On December 28-29-30, 2010, we joined the calling from our friends from the web page
        xariseto.gr. They had a bazaar in Hortiatis, Thessaloniki (Greece). The place was far from
        our city but it was near for some people that live there.</para>
      <para>Many people were bringing items they didn't need, but can be used by someone else that
        need them. You can see on the last picture <xref linkend="fig.greek2"/> what it was all
        about. We were there to inform people about FOSS and openSUSE. We had a lot of people asking
        questions about it. Mostly they didn't know that there's something different than windows.
        We hope we made a difference even to 1 person.</para>

      <para>Yesterday a small team of the Greek openSUSE community decided to go on a Christmas
        roadtrip. We traveled about 2 and a half hours to go to the beautiful border town of
        Florina. We were invited by teachers of The Educational Computer Association of Florina to
        help them promote FOSS. In the central square of the city they hard wooden houses with
        different themes (you can see the pictures). openSUSE Greek team with KLUG and a very active
        elementary teacher, Mr Ioannis Kaskamanidis, were informing people who was interested in
        what we do. Mr Kaskamanidis, brought his students with their XO laptops. Kids were showing
        their laptops with pride and giving away info packs (PromoDVDs, stickers, brochures). We
        also met with a local doctor, Dr Evangelos Tsoukas. He translated and supports the
        Electronic Medical Records program called openEMR.</para>
      <para>openSUSE team was pretty happy about promoting our distro to citizens of Florina. We
        didn't mind that we drove 200km to reach the city or the soft rain that made us to put all
        our equipment inside the wooden house. What is left from this event was:</para>

      <para>The first Kokoa and Friends meeting took place the 20th of December at the Computing and
        Electrical Department of ESPOL.</para>
      <para>This meeting supported by the openSUSE community, gathered people from different levels

        interested in using FLOSS (a.k.a. newbies), students who are <quote>candidates</quote> to
        join the Kokoa community, the current <quote>active</quote> members and the experienced
          <quote>senior</quote> members.</para>
      <para>In this event different topics were discussed covering FLOSS usage in the academia and
        the industry. Stories of success and guidelines were shared with people interested in going
        forward in the world of FLOSS.</para>
      <para>Special thanks to Cristina Guerrero, Nervo Verdezoto, Marisol Villacrés, and from
        Jarflex, Adonis Figueroa and Jessica Zuñiga the speakers of this meeting and specially to

      <para>On December 28-29-30, 2010, we joined the calling from our friends from the web page
        xariseto.gr. They had a bazaar in Hortiatis, Thessaloniki (Greece). The place was far from
        our city but it was near for some people that live there.</para>
      <para>Many people were bringing items they didn't need, but can be used by someone else that
        need them. You can see on the last picture <xref linkend="fig.greek2"/> what it was all
        about. We were there to inform people about FOSS and openSUSE. We had a lot of people asking
        questions about it. Mostly they didn't know that there's something different than windows.
        We hope we made a difference even to 1 person.</para>

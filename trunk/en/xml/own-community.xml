          >Jos Poortvliet: Events - LinuxTag and HCC linux themadag</ulink></title>
      <para>I'll be going to two <emphasis role="bold">VERY</emphasis> different events this month:
        Linux Tag with thousands of visitors and <ulink
          url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LinuxTag">a big openSUSE team</ulink> and the <ulink
          url="http://groepen.hcc.nl/home/hccplatform-linux-home/1077-hcclinuxthemadag-2011.html"
          >Dutch HCC Linux Themadag</ulink> which I expect to be <emphasis role="italic"
          >slightly</emphasis> smaller - by a factor of 10 or so.</para>

        </imageobject>        
      </mediaobject>
      <para>I'm not really sure what kind of event I like most. At LinuxTag I'll probably be more
        busy to talk to people who know a fair bit about Free Software, get interviewed, discuss
        things with other FOSS people in many one-on-one or small meetings etcetera. At HCC, well,
        there will be few people I know and most visitors are probably quite new to Linux. I really
        look forward to meeting the dutch openSUSE people (most of whom I don't know yet) and yes, I
        always enjoy talking to newbies. But LinuxTag has lots of friends, both from within openSUSE
        and from other projects - that's also awesome. </para>
      <para>I think I'm gonna decide that they're both equally cool. </para>
      <para>And if you live close to either, be sure to be there &amp; say hi to me! </para>
      <para>If you want to pick me out of the crowd, a helpful tip: my hair (both on head &amp;
        chin) got a bit longer since the pic above was taken! </para>

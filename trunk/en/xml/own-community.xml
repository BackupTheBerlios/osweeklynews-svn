      <para>As I mentioned in my <ulink url="http://omgsuse.com/content/catch-me-scale">previous post</ulink>, I am at the Southern California Linux Expo in Los Angeles this weekend. What I failed to mention 
        in my previous post was <emphasis role="bold">massive showing</emphasis> from the openSUSE community at the exposition.</para>
      <para>Throughout the day the openSUSE team was <emphasis role="bold">extremeley</emphasis> busy introducing a myriad of different people to openSUSE and SUSE Studio at 
      the openSUSE booth.</para>

      <para>Outside of the expo show floor, the team <xref linkend="fig.team"/> was also running "<ulink url="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/special-events/opensuse-day"
        >openSUSE Day</ulink>", taking the opportunity to run a few classroom-styled events on topics like: using YaST, building packages with the <ulink 
          url="https://build.opensuse.org/">OBS</ulink> and using SUSE Studio like a pro.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">At the booth</emphasis></para>
      <para>I found myself manning the booth the majority of the day, giving me an opportunity to talk with plenty of folks about one of my favorite topics: openSUSE. Due the 
        large number of Geekos (openSUSE folk) at the conference and the <emphasis role="bold">giant</emphasis> beacon of green coming from the booth, interested people clustered 
        around the booth for most of the day asking <emphasis role="italic"></emphasis>plenty of questions.</para>
      <para>I wish I could say that everybody was there because they were genuinely curious about openSUSE, but that's not entirely true. As soon as word spread about the cute 
        <ulink url="http://www.flickr.com/photos/omgsuse/5477367803/in/set-72157626140989222/">Tux and Geeko plushes</ulink> that Novell had provided the team, people started 
        dropping by asking how they could get their hands on those adorable little animals.</para>
      <para>Overall, the reactions and responses to openSUSE I got from Linux users were very positive. It <emphasis role="italic">seems</emphasis> that lots of folks out there 
        in the Linux world are apprehensive about the direction Ubuntu is heading in current, and are starting to explore other options for easy-to-use and solid distros like 
        openSUSE. (...)</para>

      <para>Greek openSUSE community in association with <ulink url="http://greeklug.gr/index.php?lang=en">GreekLUG</ulink>, helped 13th Scout Team of Thessaloniki, to upgrade 
        the hardware and install openSUSE on 3 computers. Unfortunately one computer was broken broke due to hardware malfunction, but Efstathios Iosifidis found another one and 
        replace it.</para>
      <para>Those 3 computers are very old. One of them comes with Gnome (Pentium 4 with 1GB RAM) and the other 2 with LXDE (Pentium 3 with 256MB RAM or less) but both are very 
      slow. Unfortunately they didn't have Internet installed yet, since this would be a good task for them.</para>
      <para>Kids already started to check the graphical interface and of course check some games (see the pictures).</para>
      <para>Scout organization based on volunteer work of people who want to pass some values to kids. We, as Greek Community, hope that the kids will have a lot of fun with 
      openSUSE and maybe in the future someone can provide them with better hardware so they can learn more about the futures of openSUSE. </para>

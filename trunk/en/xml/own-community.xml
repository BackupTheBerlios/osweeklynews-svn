        Project</ulink></title>
      <para>I see many people coming to the openSUSE project but only a few of them (the new people)
        actually participate in the mailing list talks and on IRC channels talks. I kept asking
        myself why? Why is this happening? Is there something wrong or what? Recently I spotted a
        new openSUSE ambassador that was too 'tight' when we were talking about community matters
        and I took the opportunity to open a conversation with him about all of the above and what I
        got from that is that people are often don't say their opinion because they fear of saying
        something wrong, also they fear on saying their different opinion when they disagree with an
        older community member and other similar situations. (...)</para>

      <para>I grew up in a small military town of Mirnij in the northwestern part of Russia. After
        school I went to study “Security of the telecommunications systems” in Saint Petersburg, but
        I’ve never been a diligent student and left the University after 3 courses. After some time,
        life brought me to Germany, where I found a job in SUSE/Novell, and where I work and to this
        day. I play the violin, love European literature and classical music. I’m married to a
        wonderful woman in world and I have a very smart and sweet son Alex :)</para>

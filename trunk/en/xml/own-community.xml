          Poortvliet: Desktop Summit: register your BoF!!!</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>A few weeks ago the <ulink
          url="https://desktopsummit.org/news/registration-workshops-bofs-now-open">registration for
          BoF's and workshops opened</ulink>. Now, it is almost July 3rd - the deadline!!! So if you
        have something to discuss at the Desktop Summit, be smart. Not registering doesn't mean you
        can't have your BoF but it DOES mean it might have to be 9 in the morning, the day after a
        party. And we all know how well attended such BoFs are ;-) </para>
      <para>Go to <ulink url="https://desktopsummit.org/program/workshops-bofs">this page</ulink>
        and register your workshop or BoF! </para>

          Poortvliet: Blog: Dutch KDE BBQ</ulink></title>
      <para>Sunday, Juli 10th I'll organize a KDE BBQ at my place, Cooklaan 7 in Utrecht. Anyone,
        including openSUSE or GNOME people more than welcome :D </para>
      <para>You're welcome from about 14:00 and I'd appreciate it if you can give me a heads-up on
        Saturday so I can make sure I have enough food :D </para>
      <para>The bbq will be done Dutch style - bring something yourself. But please, not too much, I
        don't want to have to eat meat for the next 2 weeks. I'll make sure there is some beer,
        veggies, bread etc of course. If the Weather gods don't like us we can eat inside and I
        might turn it into a curry cooking party or so but we'll decide that later on. In any case
        I'll take both herbivores and carnivores into account! </para>
      <para>Getting there: </para>
      <para>Public Transport: Go to Utrecht Central station, take the tram. Get out by Vasco Da
        Gamalaan. When you get out the tram, go right, then left to cross the street and go further
        in that direction. You'll pass a LIDL at which point you have to go left and you will find
        the Cooklaan as the first street on the left. Ring the bell at nr 7 and look sweet so I'll
        let you in. Car: use open streetmap, Google Maps or TomTom... Don't forget to look sweet at
        the door ;-) </para>

      <para>Report from EL/LAK dConference (Thessaloniki,Greece,22/05/2011) </para>
      <para>As an openSUSE Ambassador, I 'm very happy toreport for another time what took place in
        the conference. </para>
      <para>So the conference lasted 1 day </para>
      <para>The Day : Booth and Presentation </para>
      <para>We set up the booth as an openSUSE Community. All the related stuff (about Medical and
        openSUSE) was available around the booth. Furthermore me and Stathis Iosifidis informed
        people about the openSUSE Project and openSUSE Medical Project as well as the applications
        which are available via the openSUSE Medical Distro. Efstathios Agrapidis also made an
        introductory presentation about OBS. The presentation rolled out smoothly. Although there
        wasn't enough time to answer questions, the audience showed their interest by coming later
        to the booth asking for more details; not only about the platform and the infrastracture
        itself, but also about packaging generally. (...)</para>

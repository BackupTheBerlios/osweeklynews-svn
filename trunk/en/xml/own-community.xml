      </title>
      <para>On July 15-17, 2011 lizards (and not only), gathered in Katerini for the first openSUSE
        collaboration weekend camp.</para>
      <para>The event began with pool games,giving a chance to the participants to get to know each
        other.Once we were all gathered, the sessions began. Friday's sessions focused on openSUSE
        community. Great success was the translation contest. Diomedes Anadiotis managed to
        translate most words, and won a little geeko. The day concluded by the pool again partying
        and analysing the first day of the collaboration camp.</para>
      <para>The second day also consisted of interesting topics like django presented by Thodoris
        Chatzimichos member of Gentoo community, members of “The Hackerspace” and Security in
        Arduino and by John Chatzimichos who gave us his insights about Vim. Once again the day
        ended by the pool late in the evening drinking beers and partying.</para>
      <para>Gnome community “opened” the third day, which ended with an analysis of the openSUSE
        medical project.</para>
      <para>As you can see from the photos, the event was a total success as it reached its goal of
        providing education through presentations, workshops and discussions, but mainly through
        summer entertainment.</para>
      <para>Most important, all participants are unpatiently looking forward to the next
        event!</para>

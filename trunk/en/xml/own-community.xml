      <title><ulink url="http://www.bryen.com/whats-in-a-name/">Bryen Yunashko: What’s in a name?
          (Or… What should we call the openSUSE Conference?)</ulink></title>
      <para>Over the past few weeks there’s been actually two threadson the openSUSE Project mailing
        list discussing what we should call the upcoming openSUSE Conference. One proposal was to
        continue with last year’s theme calling it <quote>Collaboration Across Borders II</quote>
        and another calling it <quote>rwxrwxrwx</quote>. The other day, the program planning
        committee (including myself) took on the task of attempting to decide which one works best.
        Unfortunately, even then, we still didn’t come to an easy agreement on which name to
        choose.</para>
      <para>Both have their unique pros and cons. And ultimately whichever one we choose will impact
        how we market the conference to the world. In my opinion, both are more similar in intent
        than different, but I should probably put in a disclaimer now by mentioning that personally,
        I’m a fan of the rwxrwxrwx (or rwx3 as it’s possible variation.) And yet, both will appeal
        to different sensibilities and goals of the conference as a whole. (...)</para>

        Project</ulink></title>
      <para>I see many people coming to the openSUSE project but only a few of them (the new people)
        actually participate in the mailing list talks and on IRC channels talks. I kept asking
        myself why? Why is this happening? Is there something wrong or what? Recently I spotted a
        new openSUSE ambassador that was too 'tight' when we were talking about community matters
        and I took the opportunity to open a conversation with him about all of the above and what I
        got from that is that people are often don't say their opinion because they fear of saying
        something wrong, also they fear on saying their different opinion when they disagree with an
        older community member and other similar situations. (...)</para>

      <para>I grew up in a small military town of Mirnij in the northwestern part of Russia. After
        school I went to study “Security of the telecommunications systems” in Saint Petersburg, but
        I’ve never been a diligent student and left the University after 3 courses. After some time,
        life brought me to Germany, where I found a job in SUSE/Novell, and where I work and to this
        day. I play the violin, love European literature and classical music. I’m married to a
        wonderful woman in world and I have a very smart and sweet son Alex :)</para>

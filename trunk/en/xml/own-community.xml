          >Nelson Marques: Christmas Dinner: 11th December @ Aveiro, Portugal</ulink></title>
      <para>On the next 11th of November the Portuguese enthusiasts are meeting up for a friendly
        Christmas Dinner in the beautiful city of Aveiro in the Silver Coast of Portugal (Litoral
        Center, the famous Aveiro Geographical Delta, the biggest natural geographical delta in
        Europe). </para>
      <para>This isn’t a formal meeting, but instead an effort to get the existing enthusiasts to
        know themselves personally, to have some fun and trade ideas. During our Christmas Dinner we
        expect to receive input from our enthusiasts regarding the assembly of a Portuguese Task
        Force to handle our representation in the openSUSE International Community. </para>
      <para>Though we don’t have a stone set script for the topics some of us would like to
        approach, I would like at least to approach the following ones: </para>
      <para>* <emphasis role="bold">openSUSE Iberia</emphasis> – When I was superficially enrolled
        with the Fedora Project, I’ve tried to rebuild the Portuguese Community associated with the
        Spanish Community. It didn’t happened back then, but I rejoiced in happiness when this
        possibility was approached by Javier Lorentte and directed to Carlos Gonçalves. I am a great
        supporter of such initiative for the following reasons:</para>

          <para>Geography stands as an Opportunity; Both Portugal and Spain are the two countries on
            the ‘Peninsula Iberica’ (Iberian Peninsula) and share at least the last 1000 years of
            history. By working together we can accomplish outstanding deeds, specially related to
            Events and promotion.</para>

          <para>Culture stands as an Opportunity; Culturally speaking, Portugal and Spain are very
            similar in many ways and share the last 1000 years of History. Both countries present a
            strong Roman Catholic background, this means that societies behaviors, values and
            identity are pretty much shared between us. The language itself becomes friendly as most
            Spanish and Portuguese can actually dialog in a mix of our languages. For example the
            Portuguese language was born from Galaic-Portuguese, which is also the root of the
            language spoken in Galicia (Spain).</para>

      <para>It is 11pm and I am on my way home from LinuxDay in Dornbirn, Austria. It was a long but
        amazing day. Myriam, Mark and myself were at the KDE and Amarok booth. Surprisingly
        Christoph (a local KDE on Gentoo user/hacker) supported us rather the whole day. We were
        demonstrating our software to potentially new users talked about upcoming awesome features
        with more experienced users; we were selling some KDE merchandise articles and were giving a
        way a lot of openSUSE 11.3 CDs. Furthermore it was an excellent possibility to intensify the
        cooperation with other projects. <xref linkend="fig.lday"/></para>

      </title>
      <para>On May 14 2011, we joined the calling from our friends from the web page xariseto.gr.
        They had a bazaar in , Thessaloniki, New statue K.Karamanlis (40.622943, 22.951405 in google
        maps). </para>
      <para>Xariseto is a festival where people meet and donate their personal belongings which they
        don’t use any more. So as a Linux and openSUSE community we thought that participating in
        these kind of festivals is really interesting. </para>
      <para>Me and Efstathios Iosifidis set up a booth in order to inform people about FOSS and
        openSUSE project. We had all the related stuff about Gnome and openSUSE project around the
        booth (DVD’s , Cheat Sheet, flyer).</para>

      <para>I’m 32 and live in the Boston area. I’ve been working on Linux since 1999 and with SUSE
        since 2000. I started working with Linux by just hacking on small things and then moving on
        to specialize in file systems. These days I lead one of the SUSE Labs kernel teams, still
        focus on file systems, but also am involved in the technical leadership for the kernel in
        all SUSE and openSUSE products.</para>

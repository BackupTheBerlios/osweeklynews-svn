          >Frank Karlitschek: 2 amazing meetings to change the world</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Last week I attended two very interesting developer sprints at the SUSE office in
        Nürnberg. </para>
      <para>More and more people in the Linux world realize that a nice application installer
        (Application Store) is needed to make the Linux platform more attractive for normal users
        and third party developers. The current package managers expose way to much complexity to
        the end users. The normal users doesn´t care about dependencies, libraries and other
        internals. But the user cares about things like screenshots, description texts, ratings.
        tags, comments, recommendation from friends and other features which current package
        managers don´t provide. So the idea grow to build a better tool for finding and installing
        applications which sits on top of the current package management. </para>
      <para>It´s part of the Bretzn project to build something like this. The first sprint last week
        brought people from all major Linux distributions on one table to discuss ways to work
        together to build a common application installer API and infrastructure. Developers from
        RedHat, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, Mandriva and Mageia met and discussed ways to make
        this happen. After 2 and a half days we all agreed on an architecture and we will work in
        the next few month to bring this to all majors distributions. I´m happy that OCS was chosen
        as the standard API to access App Store Servers. </para>
      <para>The second sprint was the Bretzn sprint which took place directly afterwards and was all
        about coding. </para>
      <para>Several people from openSUSE and KDE met to build a proof of concept implementation of
        an Application Store for openSUSE and KDE. </para>
      <para>This second sprint was also super productive so after another weekend we have a basic
        App Store client together with a server running. </para>
      <para>All the basic features are in place and it just needs a bit more polishing. </para>
      <para>There is a news story coming up with some more information and screenshots. So stay
        tuned if you are looking for more information. :-)</para>

          Poortvliet: openSUSE in the Netherlands</ulink></title>
      <para>In May, the dutch "HCC" computerclub will organize a Linux day. They have asked me if
        I'd be willing to give a talk there - cool, I can do that. And if I could also set up and
        staff a booth. Slightly harder to do that on my own - so I hereby would like to ask any
        dutch openSUSE users who are willing to help out to contact me! </para>
      <para>Maybe we can do more than only that booth, there are plenty of events in the Netherlands
        and of course we should organize a openSUSE 11.4 release event to get to know each other! </para>

      </title>
      <para>What a cool and productive week! But let me start from the beginning … </para>
      <para>A couple of months ago we decided to start a <ulink
          url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspace</ulink> in Prague called <ulink
          url="http://brmlab.cz/">brmlab</ulink>. Most of the members deal with hardware, but there
        are also couple of software guys like me. At the end of November we were contacted by <ulink
          url="http://blog.tomeuvizoso.net/">Tomeu</ulink> and he asked if they can organize <ulink
          url="http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/Python2011">GNOME Python Hackfest</ulink> in our
        hackerspace. I was more than delighted about the idea, so we agreed and started to plan
        things. In the end we had 9 FOSS hackers working on GNOME and Python and I think they
        enjoyed their time in Prague. Hackerspace is a great concept, because these folks didn’t
        have to spend extra money on renting some place and our members had opportunity to meet
        foreign FOSS developers and try exotic hardware like <ulink

      <para>I had to leave the guys on Tuesday evening, because I spent the rest of the week in SUSE
        office in Nuernberg. The first three days were dedicated to <ulink

          >Cross-distribution meeting</ulink> about application installer organized by <ulink
          url="http://www.vuntz.net/journal/">Vincent</ulink>. It went more than well, we discussed
        and agreed on many things, which is great and in the end we were able to give a <ulink
          url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHeP2ZBwS_U">presentation</ulink> + we also created a
          <ulink url="http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/AppStream">nice AppStream

        organized by <ulink url="http://blog.karlitschek.de/">Frank</ulink>. The main focus of it
        was implementing some of the things we agreed on previous meeting from the KDE/Qt
        perspective and porting MeeGo Garage to openSUSE. During it I was mainly dealing with
        appdata.xml format we described in the AppStream meeting – I created an XML schema so we can
        validate it and also developed a proof-of-concept generator of this piece of metadata in
        Python. (<ulink url="http://gitorious.org/appstream">git repo</ulink>) Hope we can get it in
        createrepo and dpkg-scan* utilities soon.</para>

      <para>Here in Greece we celebrate the new year except from gifts but also by cutting a New
        Year's Pie where inside there is a coin hidden. Whoever finds it wins a special gift and is
        meant to be lucky the new year. A local Linux User Group located in Volos called Volug and
        LinuxTeam Teilar in Larisa which both teams consist of colleagues had two small parties for
        cutting the New Year's Pie. I was there to celebrate with those people and inform them about
        openSUSE and openSUSE community. They were all interested about openSUSE distribution. I
        answered many questions about Tumbleweed and Evergreen and informed them about our new 11.4
        and OBS as many of them where interested about the work that is done by openSUSE community
        and by the Greek Community. I had some cds/dvds and posters with me which i gave them. In
        the future we will make some events together. Unfortunately we did not took any pictures. I
        would slightly have won the hidden coin at the first party but the next person got it. </para>

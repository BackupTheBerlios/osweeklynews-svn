      <para>Report from EL/LAK dConference (Thessaloniki,Greece,22/05/2011) </para>
      <para>As an openSUSE Ambassador, I 'm very happy toreport for another time what took place in
        the conference. </para>
      <para>So the conference lasted 1 day </para>
      <para>The Day : Booth and Presentation </para>
      <para>We set up the booth as an openSUSE Community. All the related stuff (about Medical and
        openSUSE) was available around the booth. Furthermore me and Stathis Iosifidis informed
        people about the openSUSE Project and openSUSE Medical Project as well as the applications
        which are available via the openSUSE Medical Distro. Efstathios Agrapidis also made an
        introductory presentation about OBS. The presentation rolled out smoothly. Although there
        wasn't enough time to answer questions, the audience showed their interest by coming later
        to the booth asking for more details; not only about the platform and the infrastracture
        itself, but also about packaging generally. (...)</para>

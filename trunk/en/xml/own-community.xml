          >Kai-Uwe Behrmann: LGM Conference 2011 Montreal</ulink></title>
      <para>LGM was a quite useful chance to meet people. Jon Cruz from <ulink
          url="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</ulink> I met the first time, which was a nice
        experience. His remarks on the Cairo API for ICC support at the end of the OpenICC round
        table where interesting and I hope we can continue with that hot toppic. As well I meet
        Richard Hughes the author of colord and <ulink
          url="http://projects.gnome.org/gnome-color-manager/index.html">GCM</ulink>. We could
        settle on a specification for file based colour device configuration exchange of CMS/CMF's
        and discuss desktop colour servers, which was quite interesting. My talk was about "<ulink
          url="http://www.behrmann.name/temp/CDC2ICCb.pdf">Connecting Device Calibration to ICC
          Profiles</ulink>". </para>
      <para>With many more people I could exchange ideas and make plans. Among them where Oliver
        Berten, the author of <ulink url="http://www.selapa.net/swatchbooker/"
        >SwatchBooker</ulink>,ý Peter Linell and Jean Ghali from <ulink
          url="http://scribus.net/canvas/Scribus">Scribus</ulink> and many more. To my surprise
        Boudewijn Rempt from <ulink url="http://krita.org/">Krita</ulink> pointed out that <ulink
          url="http://www.opengtl.org/">OpenGTL</ulink>'s shiva can handle more than three colour
        channels. I would love to get support for that in Oyranos. </para>
      <para>The whole atmosphere at LGM was great and Louis and the LGM organisation team did great
        in preparing culinary and cultural program highlights additional to a wonderful conference.
        As time for coding was somewhat short, some slight improvement could be coding &amp; buffet.
        This would be a nice experience instead of the well known coding and pizza. </para>
      <para>I found the town of Montreal to be a surprisingly friendly place. People from so many
        cultural background where smiling in the streets, of course always with a arm's length
        distance, which is quite unusual in Europe. (...)</para>

      <para>I’m 32 and live in the Boston area. I’ve been working on Linux since 1999 and with SUSE
        since 2000. I started working with Linux by just hacking on small things and then moving on
        to specialize in file systems. These days I lead one of the SUSE Labs kernel teams, still
        focus on file systems, but also am involved in the technical leadership for the kernel in
        all SUSE and openSUSE products.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Editors Note</emphasis>: People of openSUSE Announcement: Because
        of GSoC, we will focus a bit more on our students in the next time. Its time for a PooS

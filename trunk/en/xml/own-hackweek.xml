    <para>With no clear plans for <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek"
        >Hackweek</ulink> this year, I decided to play even more with N950. As I quite lack some GPS
      application I decided to write it :-). The feature set will be based on things I would use,
      though I still think it will be useful for others:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Display basic GPS info (coordinates, speed, etc.)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Compass</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Moon and sun rise and set calculations for current location</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>I've named the application as GePeS and you can find sources on Gitorious: <ulink
        url="https://gitorious.org/gepes">https://gitorious.org/gepes</ulink></para>
    <para>During first day I've managed to implement basic things, check screenshots:</para>

    <para>This week is special… and not for SUSE’s employees only, but also for the openSUSE
      community. A lot of ideas from the <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/hackweek"
        >openFATE</ulink> will be implemented on this week. What’s about myself? Well… as you know I
      don’t work for SUSE anymore. Now I work for company in Göttingen, which use GNU/Linux and Free
      Software in industry sector. <ulink url="http://xplace.de/">Xplace</ulink> provide open
      solutions, for example, at POS terminals in almost all European countries. (...)</para>

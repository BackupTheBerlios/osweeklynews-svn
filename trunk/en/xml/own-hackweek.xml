  <title>Hackweek VII</title>
  <blockquote>
    <title><ulink url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/09/hack-week/">Michal Hrušecký: Hack
        Week</ulink></title>
    <para>Next week is a Hack Week. Do you know, what Hack Week is? It’s week during which we at
      SUSE come to work and work on anything we want. Anything? Well anything open source related.
      So if you normally work as a designer, you can sit down and spend a whole week hacking Linux
      kernel. Or on the other hand, as kernel developer, you can try to improve design of our web.
      What are my plans for next week? I’m not sure yet. I still have some requests regarding <ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/02/opensuse-paste-after-the-sixth-hackweek/">openSUSE
        Paste</ulink>. But as week is a long time, I would like to try something else, requiring
      more time.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">libguestfs</emphasis></para>
    <para><ulink url="http://libguestfs.org/">libguestfs</ulink> is a set of tools for accessing and
      modifying virtual machine disk images. And I would like to have it available somehow in
      openSUSE as I use virtualization quite a lot. That can be interesting and useful project for
      the next week and I think it may be useful not just for me.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Karma in Connect</emphasis></para>
    <para>Yes, here I go again. I already <ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2010/08/ideas-about-karma-in-opensuse-connect/">wrote about
        it</ulink><ulink
        url="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/03/gsoc-2011-ideas-karma-plugin-for-opensuse-connect/"
        >several times</ulink> and it is still not implemented and although I think full
      implementation would take quite some time, I could try to take a look at some simple way how
      to provide something to start with.</para>
    <para>So these are my two ideas what I may try to do next week. Not decided yet, so maybe I will
      end up with something completely different. But in the meantime, this can serve as an
      inspiration for others and if somebody would like to join me on either of these, don’t
      hesitate to leave a comment</para>

    <para>Last week we had a Hackweek at Novell. I decided to do something rather unusual for me –
      to hack a device. I bought one of these nifty <ulink
        url="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/accessories/overview/liveview"
        >LiveView</ulink> <xref linkend="fig.liveview"/> devices made by Sony Ericsson, which are basically an intelligent watch
      that can connect to your mobile phone using Bluetooth. Unfortunately, it turned out to be
      rather unusable with Android devices (lots of Bluetooth disconnects), but supposedly a
      firmware update is on its way. After I saw that, I was somehow disappointed but I thought
      there must be a way how to reverse engineer a protocol and try to connect the device to my
      computer. I started to look around on the Internet and found a great blog by <ulink
        url="http://adq.livejournal.com/">Andrew de Quincey</ulink>. What was even more cool was
      that Andrew already did most of the job and wrote some code in Python. All I had to do is to
      wrap it into classes to make it more general and thus customizable. So what’s next? My dream
      is to create a custom open-source firmware and flash the device. I hope I can achieve this
      with help of hardware wizards from our <ulink url="http://brmlab.cz/project/liveview">Prague
        hackerspace</ulink>. The source code is available from <ulink
        url="http://gitorious.org/brmlab/liveview">gitorious</ulink> as usual. Do you think that
        Hackweek lasted only until Friday for me? Well, not really, keep reading … :-)</para>

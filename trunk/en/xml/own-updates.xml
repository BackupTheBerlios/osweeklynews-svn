    <para>I am glad to introduce cairo composite manager(CCM) to factory. As the
name suggests, it&apos;s an X Window composite manager that uses Cairo for
rendering.

</para>
    <para>Some aspects I like it and hopfully you also agree with.
</para>
    <para>1. It is completely coded in Glib Object. Awesome.
</para>
    <para>2. It can work with any EWMH compliant window manager (Metacity,
Openbox, etc.). A good replacement for xcompmgr.
</para>
    <para>3. Basically, you can run it without too much hardware requirement as
it can run in 2D environment.
</para>
    <para>4. Regardless of it&apos;s simplicity compared to other composite manager,
it also provides expandable via plugin. (...)</para>

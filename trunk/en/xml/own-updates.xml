    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/pogo">Packman: pogo 0.3.1-0.pm</ulink></title>
    <para><quote>Pogo is probably the simplest and fastest audio player for Linux. Its
      elementary-inspired design uses the screen-space very efficiently. Pogo is
      especially well-suited for people who organize their music by albums on the
      hard drive. The main interface components are a directory tree and a playlist
      that groups albums in an innovative way.</quote></para>

      applications. It enables applications to benefit from multiple graphics cards, processors and
      computers to scale the rendering performance, visual quality and display size. An Equalizer
      application runs unmodified on any visualization system, from a simple workstation to large
      scale graphics clusters, multi-GPU workstations and Virtual Reality installations.

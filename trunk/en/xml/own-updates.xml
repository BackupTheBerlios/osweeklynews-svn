        </title>
        <para>The <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-suse.html">VideoLAN
                Repository</ulink> will get through some minor changes. Mainly affected are current
            users of the vlc-beta packages, BUT there is important news for all of you:</para>
        <para>The <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN Project</ulink> moved the VLC
            Player sources into the future. For this reason, vlc-beta packages as of now will only
            be built with full capabilities for openSUSE 11.4 and Factory (and future releases).
            Currently, on 11.3 I had to drop v4l2 features, as the kernel is considered too old to
            be supported by the latest VLC snapshots (See <ulink
                url="http://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/vlc-devel/2011-October/082321.html">this
                mail thread</ulink>)</para>
        <para>the existing 1.1.x packages are of course not affected, <emphasis role="bold">but
                there are plans to have 1.2 tree to become the ‘main’ tree for VLC!</emphasis> This
            would be some big news and changes coming down our way! Yay!</para>

        <para>Today I found myself with Picasa for Linux (3.0 beta) not allowing me to login to web
            albums, even if I could login without problems from the web browser.</para>
        <para>After googling a bit, it seems that Picasa 3.0 does not work anymore due to some
            Google+ related changes. On the other hand it looks like Picasa on Linux is abandoned
            ýie: 3.0 vs 3.8 on Windows. (...)</para>

        >Petr Mladek: LibreOffice 3.3.3 bugfix release available for openSUSE</ulink></title>
    <para>Iâ€™m happy to announce LibreOffice <emphasis role="italic">3.3.3 bugfix release</emphasis>
      for <emphasis role="italic">openSUSE</emphasis>. The packages are available in the Build
      Service <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Stable/"
        >LibreOffice:Stable</ulink> project. They fix various crashers, usability and translation
      problems, see the <ulink
        url="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=libreoffice-3.3.3.1"
        >libreoffice-3.3.3.1 release news</ulink> for more details. See also some notes about <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/LibreOffice">openSUSE LibreOffice build</ulink>.</para>
    <para>The openSUSE LO team hopes that you will be happy with this release. Though, any software
      contains bugs and we kindly ask you to <ulink
        url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_LO">report bugs</ulink>. It will help us to
      fix them in the future releases.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Other information and plans:</emphasis></para>
    <para>The bugfix release 3.3.4 is planed two months from now. Though, I would rather provide
      LO-3.4.2 packages instead.</para>
    <para>I am already working on the LO-3.4 packages. They are more complicated because there were
      significant changes in the build stuff. You might expect something within the next few weeks
      in the <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/"
        >LibreOffice:Unstable</ulink> project.</para>

        >Raymond Wooninck: Additional package for Chromium (on packman)</ulink></title>
    <para>As most of you already found out, Chromium is not that easy when it comes with MultiMedia.
      Due to the heavy patches from Google to ffmpeg, it does not work just to build chromium
      against the standard ffmpeg libraries. For distributions like openSUSE, Fedora, etc this
      brings issues as that ffmpeg code is still legally a no-no. </para>
    <para>There were some attempts in the past to solve this issue, but they failed. At the moment I
      have created a new package chromium-ffmpeg which delivers the missing libffmpegsumo.so
      library. The package is available from packman and it builds the patched ffmpeg code. </para>
    <para>It still doesnâ€™t really work 100%, but it should resolve some multimedia issues that
      people have been experiencing with the openSUSE Chromium package. In the meantime Chromium has
      already reached version 10.x.x.x, so check out the changes. </para>

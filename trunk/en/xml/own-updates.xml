        <para>Petr Vanek and I are maintaining some packages for openSUSE (and SLE) that build
            against the Oracle Instant Client libraries (I mean Oracle the database). Now, those
            libraries are not open source in any way, but are <ulink
                url="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html"
                >available from the Oracle TechNet website</ulink>.</para>
        <para>There are a few open source projects that are of interest, at least for people who
            have to work with the Oracle database, and we do package a few of them and <ulink

                url="http://download.yarpen.cz/">repository</ulink>.</para>
        <para>As of now, they're all built against version 10.2 of Oracle Instant Client, for <ulink

        <para>The last Week was very busy. I filled the Wiki in <ulink url="http://wiki.open-slx.de"
                >http://wiki.open-slx.de</ulink> with new Articles about Games. You can find it

            i've made with help from <ulink url="https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/lwfinger"
                >Larry Finger</ulink> from the Testing Team a couple of patches. Now after some
            tries we have now a final patch which we have committed to Factory and to the Upstream
            Project. They answered and would like to include the Patch into the next Version 0.9.0.
            This new Patch allows to run bleachbit under Kernel 3.x Series. You can update bleachbit
            through the "<ulink

    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/puddletag">Packman: puddletag
        0.9.10-0.pm.1.1</ulink></title>
    <para><quote>puddletag is a tag editor for Linux loosely based on mp3tag. It uses a table layout so
      that all the tags you want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable. puddletag excels
      at automating repetitive tasks like extracting tag information from filenames, tagging files
      from a text file or the clipboard, renaming or moving files and folders based on tags by using
      patterns, and manipulating tags using actions and regular expressions. Supported formats
      include id3v1, id3v2 (.mp3), AAC (.m4a), VorbisComments (.ogg, .flac), and APEv2 (.ape). Much
      of mp3tag's functionality has been replicated with added enhancements and tweaks.</quote></para>

    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/xmms2">xmms2
      0.7-13.pm.1011.16</ulink></title>
    <para><quote>XMMS2 is an audio framework, but it is not a general multimedia player - it will not play
      videos. It has a modular framework and plugin architecture for audio processing, visualisation
      and output, but this framework has not been designed to support video. Also the client-server
      design of XMMS2 (and the daemon being independent of any graphics output) practically prevents
      direct video output being implemented. It has support for a wide range of audio formats, which
      is expandable via plugins. It includes a basic CLI interface to the XMMS2 framework, but most
      users will want to install a graphical XMMS2 client (such as gxmms2 or esperanza).</quote></para>

    <para>Firefox 4 is knocking at the door and the <ulink
        url="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/">latest beta release</ulink> looks just
      awesome. The seventh beta release introduces several important changes, including a revamped
      user interface (with the tab location above the address bar and navigation buttons), tab
      grouping, improved bookmarking system, re-open recently closed windows, built-in synchronizing
      system, rendering engine improvements, and more. This article contains a screenshot gallery
      with all the main features and changes brought until now by Firefox 4. (...)</para>

        Manns: Updated bleachbit to Version 0.8.4</ulink></title>
    <para>I've updated bleachbit for openSUSE to Version 0.8.4. What are the changes?</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When deep scan was enabled, BleachBit 0.8.3 would freeze with the progress bar
          displaying the name of the last cleaner (so it could be any one of 90 different names).
          Sorry!</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>In addition to fixing this bug (of course), new automatic tests will prevent this from
          happening in the future. From the beginning, BleachBit has extensively used automatic
          tests to ensure quality.</para>

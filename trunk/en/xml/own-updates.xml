    <para>No, I'm not talking about this <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Board">board</ulink> -
      I'm talking about the cool project by GNOME afficianado <ulink url="http://lucasr.org/">Lucas
        Rocha</ulink> - <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject">The Board</ulink>. There
      is a little gotcha with the packages - it is for openSUSE Factory/11.4 only at the moment. I
      need to work on backporting some of the shiny dependencies to 11.3. </para>
    <para>Things aren't 100%, as I need to do a tiny bit of cleaning up with the packages, but it
      works pretty well for a 0.1.0 release ;-) (...)</para>

    <para><quote>cclive is a command line video extraction utility similar to clive but focuses on
        low requirements. Its features are few and essential. cclive is intended for users who
        prefer lightweight and <quote>snappy</quote> programs. It was written in C and depends on
        libcurl. cclive sports much of the same features but some compromises were made along the
        way to keep the prerequisites low.</quote></para>

            Vladislav Lewin (member of the YaST team) has had the nice idea writing a WebYaST plugin
            which provides a console terminal witch which the user has the opportunity to login on a
            console on the target machine. He sould be able to start any console based application
            there ( of course even YaST) (...)</para>

            and was released today. It fixes a bug that prints wrong decimal places on the PDF
            documents which results in wrong calculations on the document.ý</para>
        <para>That is a very severe and not acceptable bug, as the wrong documents could make it to
            a customer of a Kraft user and as a result harm the business. I apologize for any
            inconvenience.</para>
        <para>Please skip Kraft 0.44 and use version 0.45 instead.</para>

                    <para>Due a new caching mechanism the startup time of each module has been
                        decreased to a maximum of 1-2 seconds. So the user is able now to click
                        through WebYaST without any notable waiting time. We have made a video which
                        shows the speed improvement:<ulink

                    <para>Former versions of WebYaST were split into a service and into an UI part.
                        Each part has run in a own HTTP server. We have decided to bring these parts
                        together in order to save one HTTP server which halves the memory usage. One
                        additional benefit is that the architecture of WebYaST has simplified a
                        lot:</para>

                    <para>Due the use of one HTTP WebYaST server only the development environment
                        has been simplified very much:<orderedlist>

                                <para>Setup an environment system is much more easier now. Even a

            attention to the complete change announcement, as I just bumped the <ulink

                Packman</ulink> to 3.0.0 (from 2.18).</para>
        <para>Now, gpodder 3.0.0 does introduce a lot of changes, notably in the UI but also
            regarding its database format and requires migrating the database from 2 to 3. It
            doesn't seem to have all of the features of 2.20 either. So what happens is that when
            you just upgrade the gpodder package, you end up with something you don't necessarily
            want to use. At least as of now. (...)</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/yamdi">Packman: yamdi 1.7-0.pm</ulink></title>
    <para><quote>yamdi stands for Yet Another MetaData Injector and is a metadata injector
      for FLV files. It adds the onMetaData event to your FLV files. It uses little
      memory, is fast, and can handle big files (over 1 GB).</quote></para>

    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/xmms2">Packman: xmms2
        0.7-13.pm</ulink></title>
    <para><quote>XMMS2 is an audio framework, but it is not a general multimedia player - it will
        not play videos. It has a modular framework and plugin architecture for audio processing,
        visualisation and output, but this framework has not been designed to support video. Also
        the client-server design of XMMS2 (and the daemon being independent of any graphics output)
        practically prevents direct video output being implemented. It has support for a wide range
        of audio formats, which is expandable via plugins. It includes a basic CLI interface to the
        XMMS2 framework, but most users will want to install a graphical XMMS2 client (such as
        gxmms2 or esperanza).</quote></para>

    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/gxine">Packman: gxine
        0.5.905-2</ulink></title>
    <para>This is a GTK+ based GUI for the libxine video player library. It provides gxine, a media
      player that can play all the audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this
      includes MPEG1/2, some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based
      media (VCD, SVCD, DVD).</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/equalizer/">Packman: equalizer
        0.9.1-0.pm</ulink></title>
    <para>Equalizer is the standard middleware to create and deploy parallel OpenGL-based
      applications. It enables applications to benefit from multiple graphics cards, processors and
      computers to scale the rendering performance, visual quality and display size. An Equalizer
      application runs unmodified on any visualization system, from a simple workstation to large
      scale graphics clusters, multi-GPU workstations and Virtual Reality installations.

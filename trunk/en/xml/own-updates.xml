        Hetterich: SMB Traffic Analyzer 1.2.1 released</ulink></title>
    <para>The team is happy to announce the release of SMB Traffic Analyzer (SMBTA in the following)
      version 1.2.1. This is a very important release, as many fixes have been done for the build,
      making both smbtad and smbtatools much more portable. Also, the build has been adapted to work
      with libraries that are not installed at the usual places on the system (bnc#654930). On the
      feature side, we have two really cool things to say. First off, we are introducing rrddriver
      with this release. It is an interface to rrdtool, and allows to build a round robin database
      from the data smbtad is receiving, in real time. Having data in a rrdtool database allows you
      to create all the fancy graphics SMBTA was missing until today (bnc#655149). (...)

        >Sankar P: Introducing Sqlite-Commander - Curses Client for your SQLite
      Database</ulink></title>
    <para>I am happy to introduce to you, my recent nighttime hack "Sqlite-Commander - <ulink
        url="https://github.com/curiosity/sqlite-commander">A Curses client for your SQLite
        Database</ulink>".</para>
    <para>While I was working in a project involving sqlite, I wanted to check the contents of a
      sqlite database. The command line sqlite client involves too much of typing for viewing
      records. The sqlite viewers that I found were not very keyboard friendly. There was a firefox
      extension which looked good but I felt it is too clumsy to launch that application. Also, I
      wanted a tool that will read SQLite tables over ssh without requiring much bandwidth. I could
      not find any CUI client for SQLite and I felt it may be useful to write one, atleast for my
      satisfying my needs. So, here we have Sqlite-Commander. The name is inspired from an awesome
      piece of software Midnight-Commander written by Miguel De Icaza.</para>

        <para>It is not a full-fledged SQLite client with rich features. It is like an enriched
          version of cat for working with sqlite. I don't intend to make a release, as I am not sure
          if this will be useful for anyone other than people who work with SQLite and can use only
          a terminal/ssh. If there are enough users, I will enhance and make it a full-fledged
          product. So drop me a mail if you are interested in this project.</para>

        <para>It should be fairly straight-forward to implement connectivity to any database (MySQL,
          Oracle, etc.) such that we can have a generic SQL NCurses client. It will be a good

    <para>Credits are due for the awesome mono-ncurses interface authors (Miguel and Co.) If you are
      looking to writing some terminal application I can heartily recommend that mono-ncurses is the
      best library you will ever get. Before beginning this application, I evaluated a few options
      (like Python etc.) and nothing comes close to being as easy to use as <ulink
        url="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoCurses">mono-ncurses</ulink>. Also, special thanks to
      VIM and git, two of the most productive tools ever invented. </para>

        >Raymond Wooninck: openSUSE KDE:Unstable:SC repo becomes Trunk again !</ulink></title>
    <para>A little warning to those that have switched over to the KDE:Unstable:SC repo. The target
      is that either tonight or tomorrow a new Trunk snapshot will be loaded in this repo. That
      would mean that the Unstable becomes unstable again.</para>
    <para>I have already been building a number of snapshots based on the opened KDE 4.7 trunk and
      have to admit that things are still looking very stable and even kdebindings is compiling well
      :-) But this might of course change from the moment that KDE 4.6 has been released and the
      focus shifts to the newer 4.7 release. </para>
    <para>I will keep you posted on the developments around this repository, but this would be the
      moment to switch over to KDE:Distro:Factory if you want to get the RC1, RC2 and KDE 4.6 final
      version for your openSUSE system. Currently it contains RC1, but this would change in the next
      few days once RC2 is released. </para>

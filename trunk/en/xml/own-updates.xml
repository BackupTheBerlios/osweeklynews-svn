        </title>
        <para>Some might remember my hackweek project Zippl. I <ulink
                url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/11/zippl-a-lightweigth-presentation-tool/"
                >blogged about it</ulink> more than a year ago. Zippl is a lightweigt presentation
            tool, a bit like prezi, a hipp tool for that purpose, where all ‘slides’ sit on one
            large canvas and during the presentation a kind of camera moves over the canvas.</para>
        <para>I liked the idea and did Zippl as I wanted to play with Qt’s QGraphicsView. It takes a
            simple xml file as input which describes the presentation and animates it as shown in
            the video in my <ulink
                url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/11/zippl-a-lightweigth-presentation-tool/"
                >older blog</ulink>.</para>
        <para>First I thought it doesn’t make sense to continue that project. But recently, somebody
            asked if I have built in the feature back to the previous spot as I promised almost a
            year ago, as he wanted to do a presentation with Zippl. I couldn’t believe, and so I
            spent an evening in the weekend to polish Zippl a bit. And because its easy with OBS, I
            quickly built an rpm package for various openSUSEs.</para>
        <para>Now that I worked on it a bit again I found it could also make sense on tablet
            devices, for example to run cool Hello New User animations or small presentations for
            ant Tilly to get some sponsorship for the new bike. Could be fun.If you want to check
            it, please install from <ulink

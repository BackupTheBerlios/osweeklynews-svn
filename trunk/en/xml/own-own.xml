    <para>
        <programlisting>200 issues of the openSUSE weekly news - that means nearly 4 years of 
monitoring what's happening around openSUSE, writing nicely about it on tight 
schedule, translating it so that people have access in their native tongue to 
some information,... I'm impressed and gratefull for your service to the 
openSUSE project.

Thanks,
Andreas</programlisting>

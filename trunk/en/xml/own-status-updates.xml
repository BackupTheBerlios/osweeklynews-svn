      <para>In the last two weeks 457 package checkins were done for openSUSE:Factory. The legal

        smaller ones.  LibreOffice has 110.000 files, so the legal review will take some time. Out
        of the 457 package checkins, I&apos;ll only highlight a few below. Quite a few package checkins
        were to fix build failures from the no-copy-dt-needed change and on improving systemd

          trying very hard to avoid hierarchies, policies and rules. It emphasizes the creative, a
          bit chaotic, side of the FOSS ways for openSUSE to get things done, quickly. Everyone that

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for

          <para>Ray&apos;s comment starting with &quot;Every flicker and mode change in the boot

          <para>An easy way to remove Software! For example: you installed an application with &quot;1-click install&quot; (which will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1 click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another words: an &quot;1-click Uninstall&quot; to remove installed software (dependencies and packages included).</para>

          </title>
          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

        </title>
        <para>Respecting users is a priority to the openSUSE Project so when something does not work
          the way it should be, taking a step back is more preferable than delivering something that
          is not ready yet. For that reason yesterday afternoon<ulink url="http://www.kroah.com/"> Greg K.H</ulink>. announced to the <ulink url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/">openSUSE-factory mailing list</ulink>
          that systemd is being removed from <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</ulink> so that users won’t have a problem with it. That way it will allow
          developers to spend more time on working on it in order to have systemd ready for the
          upcoming 12.1 instead of chasing problems that are specific to Tumbleweed.</para>
        <para>Here is the <ulink url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-09/msg00877.html">e-mail</ulink>
          from Greg K.H. announcing the removal of systemd from Tumbleweed:<blockquote>
            <para>Due to a number of inter dependencies on packages that are not ready for
              Tumbleweed, and other interactions with the system that are causing problems for some
              users, I’m going to remove systemd from Tumbleweed today to allow the developers to
              spend more time on getting it stable for Factory and 12.1 instead of having to chase
              down problems that are specific to Tumbleweed only.</para>
            <para>So if you have installed systemd in Tumbleweed, I suggest you now remove it with a
              simple:</para>

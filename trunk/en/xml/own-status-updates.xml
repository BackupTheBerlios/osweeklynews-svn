          Enlightenment 1.0.0 for openSUSE</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>It’s been a long time since I was in touch with Enlightenment, back in the young days I
        used it as my first alternative Desktop Environment on Windows, before actually daring to
        switch to Linux. </para>
      <para>Today I hear that version 1.0.0 of the core libraries have been released. Reason enough
        to actually look into this again. So 1 hour, many build failures and successes later, I have
        the entire core-stack built in my obs repository home:dimstar:Enlightenment. The window
        manager Enlightenment itself is not yet released as full release, but the latest snapshot
        can be found in my repo as well. </para>
      <para>But that’s it so far: all core libraries are built. Nothing more. I did not even have
        time to test them yet. </para>
      <para>If you feel adventurous, go, add the repository obs://home:dimstar:Enlightenment to your
        system (published for openSUSE 11.3 and Factory) and start playing with all of the things,
        starting with the window manager, which should generally pull in the rest. What should be
        required (as
        root)<screen>zypper ar obs://home:dimstar:Enlightenment Enlightenment
zypper in enlightenment</screen></para>
      <para>This will add my home repository to your catalog list and install enlightenment
        including dependencies. One logout later, you should see Enlightenment as a new session type
        in your *DM. </para>
      <para>Have a lot of fun and share your experiences… I will test it after I get some
        sleep.</para>

        I&apos;ve now updated my Drupal 7 appliances on <ulink url="http://susestudio.com/">SuSE Studio</ulink> to the latest release. The appliance is based on <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/113/en">openSUSE Linux 11.3</ulink> and is available in
        two variants:<itemizedlist>

      <para>The database backend is phpMyAdmin has been added to support web-based administration of
        the MySQL server. You can access it via http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/. I also added <ulink url="http://drush.ws/">drush</ulink>, the Drupal command line shell and scripting
        interface and some additional packages (yast2-http-server, bind-utils, php5-ctype, patch). I
        also bumped up the appliance&apos;s version number to 7.0.0, to match the version number of
        Drupal included. </para>
      <para>The appliance is available in various formats:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A live raw disk image, ready to be written to an USB stick or flash drive</para>

      <para>So congratulations to the Drupal developer community for reaching this goal and thanks
        to SuSE/Novell/Attachmate for providing the infrastructure for creating such appliances. I
        also would like to especially thank <ulink url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/rbos/">Richard Bos</ulink> for the testing and many suggestions for improvement of these
        appliances!</para>

          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder

            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a

                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>I just pushed a new osc feature to git master which allows you to edit a submit
          action. Use case: suppose you review a request (which has at least one submit action) and
          you find a small typo (for instance in the spec file) but except the typo everything is
          fine. So instead of declining the request you can fix the typo, create a new request
          (which contains the fix + the original changes), accept the newly created request and
          supersede the original request (that’s basically what osc does behind the scenes).</para>
        <para>Example:<screen>    # request with id 80 needs a small fix
    marcus@linux:~&gt; osc rq show 80 –edit
    Request: #80

    submit:       home:Admin/foo  -&gt; home:foobar/dest

        <para>As many people will know I've spent around 18 months of my spare time packaging and
          building the Netbook UX for Moblin/MeeGo on openSUSE. Not on my own, but with a community
          around me. I would just like to say a huge thank you to that community, you've been great
          and spurred me on when I felt like the whole world was conspiring against me. </para>
        <para>Sound a bit morose? Well in a way it is. Basically by all accounts MeeGo is stopping
          all work on the Netbook UX. Yup, all our hard work is now almost for nothing :-( </para>
        <para>The first piece of evidence is the <ulink
            url="http://wiki.meego.com/Release_Engineering/Plans/1.2">Release Engineering Plans for
            1.2</ulink>. If you look at the bottom, you'll notice that the Netbook doesn't get any
          mention in Features, just bugs. Actually the same is for the 1.1 release. In all honesty,
          the biggest change between 1.1 and its predecessor is that all refernces to Moblin was
          replaced with MeeGo. The next piece of info came at the fabulous FOSDEM XI (I'll do a
          seperate post on the event later). I spoke to several people directly and indirectly
          involved with MeeGo, especially the Netbook UX, about the lack of info on the Netbook UX.
          Each one of them said the same thing - MeeGo is putting the Netbook UX into Maintanence
          Mode, stopping any further development on it, and only providing bug fixes for major
          issues. I asked if there was going to be any announcement, basically the answer was
          nothing official. They're just going to let it drift away - just like netbooks themselves
          have. </para>
        <para>There are most likely a huge number of reasons, which is fair enough. I was given a
          couple of reasons - 1: Netbooks arent selling anymore, the Netbook ship didn't really sail
          away, but was sunk. 2: MeeGo doesn't want to invest anymore time or effort in gtk
          development, and wants to concentrate on Qt. Now I take this last one with a tiny bit of
          salt, only because both Intel and Nokia employ (or at least did so) a sizable team of
          GNOME developers. Saying that though, if they want to keep a roof over their heads they
          have to do what their employer says, and both originally started working with touch
          devices. So it does make sense as much as it doesn't. </para>
        <para>So, I herby give immediate notice that I am now no longer going to be doing any
          further work on the MeeGo UX for openSUSE or anyone else. I wont delete the repo for 1.0
          but will clear out the 1.1 and 1.2 repos that I had - might as well give those resources
          back :-) . Now if anyone would like to continue what I and others had started, then let me
          know and I would be more than happy. </para>
        <para>I cant say what the other distros are going to do, I've spoken to my counter part in
          Fedora, and they're having a think about it as they were busting their chops to get things
          in for the F15 release. Either way I wish all involved luck. </para>
        <para>Now before any of you conspiracy theory junkies get worked up - this has nothing to do
          with the whole MeeGo Trademark issue that Smeegol had with the Linux Foundation. As it
          happens I was due to have a conversation with the Linux Foundation about the issues
          between us and them, but have had to re-schedule due to travel constraints from one party
          or the other. I still intend to speak with the LF about the issues, as they are still
          present in the other UX's that they are developing. </para>
        <para>So it's time for me to close off and say, so long and thanks for all the fish! I'll
          still be around, I'll probably start getting back into the GNOME swing of things, and help
          fcrozat with GNOME3 etc. Oh and I've got a lunatic idea for a project which I intend to
          kick off (stay tuned ;-) ). </para>

        <para>This is probably one of the most controversial features that has been subject of
          continuous work from the Ayatana Project. This two pieces of software work as one and
          allow to export GTK+ application menus through DBus, being the end result: application
          menus present on the gnome-panel and unity-panel. </para>
        <para>This feature requires at least one patch on GTK stack. I’ve talked to Ubuntu devs
          regarding this patch, and it was told to me that GTK+ upstream had no interest on
          upstreaming this patch. I’m not the one to comment this move from upstream, but I find it
          at least interesting that QT has upstreamed an identical patch which includes the same
          functionality. Since they are competing products (one can replace other totally or
          partially), such actions only strengthen QT. Adding a bit of speculation and the latest
          statements from Shuttleworth regarding QT, I wonder if it is to be expecting some ‘wind of
          change’… who knows?! </para>
        <para>For us at openSUSE what does matter is if we can Factor’ize this at least the Menu
          Proxy patch so we can offer Unity and Indicators at the original form and not crippled. I
          will request soon this changes to GNOME:Factory and we’ll see what people say, regardless
          of upstream positions. </para>
        <para>This is on-development software, and has some itches, but for the most it works (GTK+
          applications), I would expect some polishing in the future from upstream, either way, it’s
          another option.</para>

            at openSUSE: openSUSE 11.4 KDE-testing</ulink>
        </title>
        <para>It’s been a while and there was nothing special to report, KDE SC 4.5 just worked. In
          the meantime KDE SC 4.6 was released and openSUSE offers it in <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/KDE_repositories">KDF as well as KR46 repos</ulink>. Big
          thanks to everybody who is involved in establishing and maintaining those repos – openSUSE
          really profits a lot from the (openSUSE-)KDE community that makes it possible to provide
          such a nice and updated KDE distro. </para>
        <para>Those updating from KDE 4.4 which came with openSUSE 11.3 to 4.6 – please save your
          plasma* files from ~/.kde4/share/config in case plasma crashes after the update.
          Submitting them to Novell’s bugzilla would be much appreciated in order to get those
          crashes fixed for openSUSE 11.4. The same applies to all other issues that come up when
          updating KDE 4.4 to 4.6, e.g. kdepim-related. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE SC 4.6</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>KDE 4.6 has some nice fixes, among them <ulink url="http://bugs.kde.org/163707">bko
            bug 163707</ulink> which prevented KDE from restoring the resolution set in
          systemsettings on login. This is especially important to openSUSE users since sax2 is gone
          and display settings moved into the desktop environment. Plasma seems to become more
          stable with every release – in fact I did not have any major issues with it since ages and
          bug fixing is pretty fast as well. Dolphin does also not suffer from buggy dbus packages
          anymore and with the latest strigi packages I do not encounter any crashes on close or
          when hovering certain files which did crash dolphin before. Thanks to remur_030 who helped
          the strigi people tracking the latter down for .msi files and thereby found and fixed some
          general issue in strigi which could cause crashes. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Desktop search </emphasis></para>
        <para>The desktop search does still not justify its name though since basics are still
          missing, e.g. context given for search results as all other desktop searches do and kerry
          + beagle already did years ago. <ulink
            url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/someone-requested-excerpts-for-query-results/"
            >The feature was shown some months ago</ulink> but is not as such available in KDE 4.6 –
          thus even in KDE 4.6 all the user gets is a replacement of kfind + tagging which needs a
          huge database for that simple task. </para>
        <para>On top of that there are still issues with <ulink
            url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246678">virtuoso-t hogging the CPU</ulink>,
          its database never decreasing in size but only increasing, even if you remove folders from
          the “to be indexed”-list and the systray-tool used to suspend the indexing vanished as
          well decreasing transparency to the user of an app which potentially keeps your hard disk
          and CPU busy. </para>
        <para>Yes, I know there is always a shortage of manpower but IMHO if an app fails to provide
          the very basic features regarding the functionality its name advertises, it will not gain
          any acceptance among users and since every xth user is also a developer it will not
          attract developers either. Thus the extent of this manpower shortage is self-imposed in
          case of nepomuk aka desktop search. </para>
        <para>I think its a bit unfortunate that strigi is always blamed for anything related to the
          desktop search in KDE although it is just the tool that is used by nepomuk and its usage
          is up to nepomuk and not strigi itself, i.e. when to start hammering the hard disk, how to
          handle the results within a database, what results to display when searching, giving the
          user control and information regarding its activities etc. From my experience strigi devs
          are quite responsive regarding bugs and questions – although their websites are all pretty
          much outdated. :) </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 there is still one major mystery bug to solve for openSUSE 32-bit
          NVIDIA users which get <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251719">several
            apps crashing since they updated to KDE &gt;= 4.5</ulink>. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Power-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Power-management got worse in KDE 4.6, regressions such as not disabling
          powermanagement on desktops and thus suspending the display every 10 minutes, the
          brigtness slider not representing 100% of the brightness supported by the notebook and it
          still messes with the brightness the user has set. All these were reported some weeks ago
          already. Let’s hope that KDE SC 4.6.1 fixes those since that seems to be the version that
          openSUSE 11.4 will ship. </para>
        <para>Further having a presentation-scheme (no suspend, no dimming etc.) is kind of useless
          with KDE 4.6 since it will change to the next scheme if the battery hits any limit. Thus
          you have to permanently watch the status and switch back to the presentation-scheme to be
          save of a suspending notebook while you watch a movie within the presentation or during
          some longer discussion which leads to you not moving the mouse for some minutes. </para>
        <para>Ignoring the scheme the user manually set does indeed make sense but only for the last
          5% of your battery and in order to avoid the notebook just turning off because there was
          no power left. </para>
        <para>openSUSE 11.4 milestones also features a powermanagement bug that makes your hard disk
          suspend every few minutes, confirmed but no fix so far. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Package-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 we are currently <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_packagekit">testing
            kpackagekit/apper</ulink> as a replacement for the unmaintained kupdateapplet.
          Kpackagekit works ok but it seems that its zypper backend could need some improvements.
          And the next version of kpackagekit which will be called apper features monochrome systray
          icons which is fine, but the “security patch available” signal is just a tiny red dot
          which is hardly visible, especially if your eye-sight is not the best or you are suffering
          red-green colour blindness. So most issues with kpackagekit are not actually kpackagekit’s
          fault but either backend-related or touching artists’ taste. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Phonon-backends</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Another application <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_phonon-backend">to test is the
            phonon-backend</ulink> to be used in openSUSE 11.4 by default. Should we stay with xine
          whose backend is apparently unmaintained but has served most users well, switch to the
          vlc-backend or maybe use the gstreamer-backend? </para>
        <para>Trying to play some file with amarok and the gstreamer-backend brings up some dialogue
          (/usr/lib/gst-install-plugins-helper) that asks whether it should search for some package,
          I guess codecs. If one clicks on “search” kpackagekit opens up and claims instantly that
          “Getting what provides” finished but does not do anything. This is on 11.3 plus KDE 4.6
          from KDF, so let’s hope it works better on 11.4. </para>
        <para>The vlc-backend consumes the double amount of CPU for playing the same mp3 via amarok.
          8% instead of 4% might not be that much in absolute terms but a 100% waste nonetheless and
          especially on mobile devices everything that wastes battery should be avoided. Further
          there seem to be issues playing video via vlc, some apps like dragonplayer. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE-PIM </emphasis></para>
        <para>And finally there is of course the always present issue of KDE-PIM. openSUSE 11.4 will
          ship kdepim 4.4.10 which needs testing. There is especially <ulink
            url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185544">one annoying bug which makes kontact
            crash</ulink> when logging in if the last view before logging out was kmail. So let’s
          hope this can be fixed before 11.4 gets released.</para>
        <para>I was really looking forward to KDE-PIM 4.6 since IMAP-support seems a lot better with
          akonadi, at least for my use-cases which include suspending/resuming. The latter makes
          KDE-PIM 4.4′s imap slave fail and not recover which works fine with KDE-PIM 4.6. You can
          get regularly updated packages for the latter off openSUSE’s UNSTABLE KDE repo. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Help testing </emphasis></para>
        <para>Please help testing KDE SC 4.6 from the openSUSE repos in order to make it shine in
          openSUSE 11.4. Feedback can go to the related wiki pages or straight to
          opensuse-kde@.</para>

        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>

        <para>LO switched to a time based schedule and more frequent bug fix releases. The purpose
          is to keep quality and avoid infinite RC phase at the same time. The idea is that all
          serious blocker bugs can be found and fixed within few weeks. Then the application is
          ready for masses who want to enjoy new features and more complicated fixes. The history
          says that bugs in less typical scenarios are found weeks after the release. Such bugs will
          be fixed in pure bug fix releases and released few weeks after each other. It means that
          more conservative people should rather wait for the 3.x.1, 3.x.2, 3.x.3 releases. We hope
          that it will help all people to get faster what they want. </para>

        <para>The Testing Core Team IRC meeting was held Jan. 31, 2011 at 18:00 UTC. The next one
          will be on the Monday following the release of 11.4 RC1 at 18:00 UTC. </para>
        <para>In our meeting, we discussed our experiences with 11.4 M6 and discussed bugs that we
          have encountered. We also discussed how to improve the openQA testing to catch problems
          that would interfere with installation; however, this will always be problematic. For
          example, the x86_64 DVD from Build 1034 turned out to be too large to burn to a standard
          single-layer DVD. At the time of the decision to release that buid as 11.4 M6, the testing
          process was working on Build 1033, which did not have this problem. </para>
        <para>My personal set of bugs were mostly due yo problems with software other than 11.4 M6.
          The NET install CD failed to boot after installation on a VirtualBox VM, but the KDE Live
          CD installed OK on that same VM. The problem was with VirtualBox 4.0.0 (4.0.2 works fine).
          I also have one system that uses the i915 graphics driver that boots with a garbled
          screen, but it works with the "nomodeset" boot option. That is a kernel problem, not with
          openSUSE 11.4 and the bug report was placed at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/"
            >http://bugzilla.kernel.org</ulink>.. </para>
        <para>It is extremely important to test M6 so that as many bugs as possible are found and
          fixed. Remember that your hardware may have problems not seen by other testers. Remember
          that it is essential to report the bugs, otherwise thay may not be fixed by the final
          release of 11.4. </para>

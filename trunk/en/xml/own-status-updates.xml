      <para>The GNOME team plans to have GNOME 3.2 in for openSUSE 12.1 and thus have updated to the

          trying very hard to avoid hierarchies, policies and rules. It emphasizes the creative, a

          <ulink url="http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2011/04/17/evergreen-status-after-some-months/">Wolfgang Rosenauer: Evergreen status after some months</ulink>
        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good
          balance between a few, most probably contradictory things:<itemizedlist>

                that)</para>

          cases that we want to enable and support and what you believe would be cases of abuse,
          especially if you have been involved or have been pondering about making a derivative of
          openSUSE or, more generally, use the openSUSE trademarks in one way or another. </para>

          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

And then we discovered that <ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</ulink> did not support elliptical arcs in the path at all, just ignored them. Fortunately, there was <ulink url="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/libs-gui/commit/?id=246168e94709a5ea7f34914d8e246af0985a9c81">this patch</ulink> of a hacker extraordinaire, <ulink url="http://blog.thebehrens.net/">Thorsten</ulink> that was used to teach <ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</ulink> some sane behaviour.

    <para>The agenda calls for discussion of our experiences with 12.1 MS3. As this release will
          likely not be available until next week, our discussion may be limited.</para>
    <para>Our second agenda item will concern our request to rename MS6 to Beta in hopes of
          increasing the number of testers in the critical late stages of testing. Our request was
          posted to the opensuse-project mailing list and has been discussed on opensuse-testing and
          opensuse-factory. Most of the comments have been favorable, and Stephan Kulow, the Release
          Manager, has agreed to make the name change although he doubts that it will make much
          difference. Coolo also asked how we will measure the effect of this change. If you have
          ideas on this matter, please forward them to the TCT.</para>

        </title>
        <para>Here&apos;s a short note as to the status of some recent activity in the
          openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the kernel is at the 2.6.38 release level tracking the upstream stable 2.6.38
              releases.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>lxde (and its sub-packages) was added</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>calibre was added</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>other smaller packages were added</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>KDE update seems stable and working. It&apos;s in the openSUSE:Tumbleweed:KDE repo if
              anyone wants to test it out now. I&apos;ll be working next few weeks to merge this into the
              main openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo as my bandwidth allows.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>There is a GNOME 3.0 Tumbleweed repo at openSUSE:Tumbleweed:GNOME. It&apos;s properly
              building right now, but the same caveats remain for the main GNOME 3.0 repo (i.e.
              network manager issues with KDE, and other minor stuff), so I can&apos;t merge it to the
              main openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo just yet. I&apos;ll wait for these changes to settle down,
              but if you want, feel free to try out the repo for your GNOME 3.0 systems running
              Tumbleweed. I&apos;ll keep it up to date as the changes merge into the main GNOME 3.0
              repo.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>artwork questions were raised with one proposed logo already sent in. More to come
              in this area hopefully soon.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>There were a few &quot;version downgrades&quot; that happened as the upstream project
              release number was changed to reflect the basesystem release number correctly. This
              will probably continue to happen as this change is propagated throughout the openSUSE
              build system to fix up these errors by the various developers. You can safely ignore
              them when they happen.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>As always, if anyone knows of any packages they wish to see added to Tumbleweed,
          please let me know.</para>
        <para>Please read the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed">wiki page for Tumbleweed</ulink> if you have any basic questions about what it is or how to use it.
          Any other questions, please ask them on the <ulink url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/">opensuse-factory mailing list</ulink>.</para>

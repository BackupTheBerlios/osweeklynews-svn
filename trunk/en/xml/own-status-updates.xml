          Tuxies favorite boy group, but a bunch of people dedicated to help the openSUSE Project in
          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder
              how Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

                <ulink url="http://build.opensuse.org">web interface</ulink>. After long working
              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good
                <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/projectstatus?project=openSUSE%3AFactory"
                >overview page</ulink> for the Factory project in OBS. It grew a bit more ambitions,

            <para>In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in
              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              Vincent rocked GUADEC and gave away Geekos and stuff and advertised openSUSE as a good

                <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE Conference</ulink>.
              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>openFATE, Connect and more</para>
            <para>After the conference and the release of 11.3 we started to dig into milestones
              again with <ulink url="http://features.opensuse.org">openFATE</ulink> and <ulink
                url="http://connect.opensuse.org">Connect</ulink>. Since a couple of weeks we have a

              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.
          Promised!</para>

          2.2.72, another alpha release for OBS 2.3. The most significant change to former alpha
          snapshots is the switch to apache. We do so for a number of reasons:</para>
        <orderedlist>

        </orderedlist>
        <para>We think that some bugs like the invalid occassional empty replies by the api server
          are solved via this switch as well.</para>
        <para>The <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Appliance">OBS 2.2.72 appliance</ulink> is already comming with apache setup. Please note that we use also SSL
          by default, a default SSL CA is created on bootup and becomes part of your data
          partition.</para>
        <para>In case you use <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools:/Unstable/">the packages</ulink> outside of the appliance, you need to do some configuration steps. But
          don’t worry, a apache vhost file comes with the packages already and only a few steps need
          to be done, the README files should reflect this already.</para>
        <para>lighttpd setups should still work, but please note that lighttpd is running with an
          own user id (“lighttpd”) and the default is now the generic “wwwrun” user for some
          directories.</para>

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </title>
        <para>With the release of GNOME3 I would assume that people are interested in seeing how
          YaST2 (suggestion: rename it to YaST3 !!) is going to take form with GTK3. Of course this
          means eventually writing another application in GTK3, hopefully different from the old
          gnome-control-panel ‘style’ which was actually pretty confusion from the user point of
          view as it was far too close to gnome-control-center, thus confusing new comers.</para>
        <para>My suggestion (unaware if it’s possible or not) was probably to explore GNOME3
          features to serve YaST integrated already with GNOME3. This could be an interesting
          approach as it would offer integration and some advantages:</para>
        <para>* Better integration with GNOME3 without having to write(/maintain another
          application;</para>
        <para> * Take advantage of YaST2 modular structure;</para>
        <para> * Present YaST in a prime space in GNOME3, thus offering a
          openSUSEýdifferentiationýpoint;</para>
        <para> * No conflicts with possible KDE existing front-ends for YaST2;</para>
        <para> * Improve users experience.</para>
        <para>My proposal would be something like (maybe to be served as an extension for
        gnome-shell). Please neglect my ‘lame’ photo manipulation skills:</para>

            Kügler: What’s new in Plasma Active?</ulink>
        </title>
        <para>We’ve been busy bees in the growing Plasma Active team, so it’s time to post some
          progress updates. In case you forgot, Plasma Active is a KDE project to create a desirable
          user experience for the device spectrum, with its first focus to create a system suitable
          for tablet computers. In my <ulink
            url="http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/plasma-active-a-desirable-user-experience-encompassing-the-device-spectrum/"
            >first post</ulink> about Plasma Active, you can see the basic shell running on a 10
          inch Viewsonic Viewtab. In this post, I’m using a Wetab to demo the current state of
          Plasma Active. The Wetab is one of our test devices. It’s a nice target device since it’s
          Intel Atom-based, which makes building Plasma Active a bit easier, and thus shortens our
          development-testing-deployment cycles considerable. The Wetab can currently be gotten from
          German Ebay for 219⃽ + shipping, so it’s also quite affordable. </para>
        <para> Back to the software, though. Our focus in the past weeks has been two-fold, we’ve
          done a lot of “small fixes” which greatly improve the user experience. The other class of
          changes is less visible at this point, but still fun and exciting. (...)</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good

            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping

        <para>The <emphasis role="italic">3.3.2</emphasis> release is in a very good shape, so we
          decided to slow down the bug fixes release cycle. You might expect the <emphasis role="italic">3.3.3</emphasis> bug fix release two months from now.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">LO-3.4</emphasis> feature freeze is pretty close and we will
          start producing test packages in the <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/">LibreOffice:Unstable</ulink> project. Please, be patient because there are many
          interesting changes in the build framework. They are good for the future but I expect some
          problems with packaging. I hope that I will manage to provide something by the end of
          April.</para>

        <para>The Testing Core Team met on Monday, April 11 at 17:00 UTC on our usual IRC channel. </para>
        <para>Regarding the Open Bugs Day that was held on Saturday April 2, we discussed the
          reasons for the low turnout, the means of disposition of bugs, and the bugs that are still
          open. To see the distribution of bug type versus release, see <ulink url="http://tinyurl.com/392jnb">http://tinyurl.com/392jnb</ulink>. Even after the large
          number of bugs that were closed, there are still 7 open bugs for 10.0, 14 for 10.1 and 46
          for 10.3. All bugs for 10.2 are closed. </para>
        <para>We next discussed what was good and bad about the 11.4 testing cycle, and what we
          might do to improve the quality of the final product. I expect that we will be discussing
          this topic again during the 12.1 development cycle. </para>
        <para>Our next meeting will be May 9 at 1700 UTC. This meeting is scheduled to follow the
          release of 12.1 M1.</para>

        </title>
        <para>Here&apos;s a short note as to the status of some recent activity in the
          openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the kernel is at the 2.6.38 release level tracking the upstream stable 2.6.38
              releases.</para>
          </listitem>

            <para>lxde (and its sub-packages) was added</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>other smaller packages were added</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>KDE update seems stable and working. It&apos;s in the openSUSE:Tumbleweed:KDE repo if
              anyone wants to test it out now. I&apos;ll be working next few weeks to merge this into the
              main openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo as my bandwidth allows.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>There is a GNOME 3.0 Tumbleweed repo at openSUSE:Tumbleweed:GNOME. It&apos;s properly
              building right now, but the same caveats remain for the main GNOME 3.0 repo (i.e.
              network manager issues with KDE, and other minor stuff), so I can&apos;t merge it to the
              main openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo just yet. I&apos;ll wait for these changes to settle down,
              but if you want, feel free to try out the repo for your GNOME 3.0 systems running
              Tumbleweed. I&apos;ll keep it up to date as the changes merge into the main GNOME 3.0
              repo.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>artwork questions were raised with one proposed logo already sent in. More to come
              in this area hopefully soon.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>There were a few &quot;version downgrades&quot; that happened as the upstream project
              release number was changed to reflect the basesystem release number correctly. This
              will probably continue to happen as this change is propagated throughout the openSUSE
              build system to fix up these errors by the various developers. You can safely ignore
              them when they happen.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>As always, if anyone knows of any packages they wish to see added to Tumbleweed,
          please let me know.</para>
        <para>Please read the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed">wiki page for Tumbleweed</ulink> if you have any basic questions about what it is or how to use it.
          Any other questions, please ask them on the <ulink url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/">opensuse-factory mailing list</ulink>.</para>

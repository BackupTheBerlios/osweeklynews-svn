      <para>In the last two weeks 457 package checkins were done for openSUSE:Factory. The legal
        queue is very small and contains only 7 packages including two large packages: chromium
        which might end in Factory and LibreOffice 3.4 - with a large tarball instead of many
        smaller ones.  LibreOffice has 110.000 files, so the legal review will take some time. Out
        of the 457 package checkins, I&apos;ll only highlight a few below. Quite a few package checkins
        were to fix build failures from the no-copy-dt-needed change and on improving systemd
        support in openSUSE. (...)</para>

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        <para>The last couple of weeks have been ridiculously busy. Or, if you prefer (and I do):
          ridicubusy. On the personal side of life, I managed to squeeze in a two day
          paddle-and-camping trip the other weekend, played dinner host to Lawrence Krauss (made
          some of my favourite dishes, and one new one (for me, anyways): egg yolk ravioli),
          co-hosted a &quot;Ready, Steady, Cook!&quot; evening at the house along with S. All of that was
          enjoyable, and great breaks between the long hours of working on Plasma and general KDE
          &quot;stuff&quot;.</para>
        <para>A lot of what I&apos;ve been working in the last two weeks has been involved writing source
          code, but working on community, technology roadmap and business issues. I&apos;ve managed to
          get some good hacking hours in, too, but not as much as usual as I&apos;ve been paying more
          than the usual attention to these other, also-important areas.</para>
        <para>Some of what I&apos;ve been working on will (if all goes well) get to the next step this
          week. A half dozen or so of us are congregating again in Darmstadt, Germany to collaborate
          on Plasma Active issues. We&apos;ll be focussing on getting to a high quality Plasma Active
          One, what we wish to do after that, our plans for libplasma2 and Frameworks 5, the next
          iteration of UI implementation concepts as we fully realize the Contour concepts, hardware
          related issues and the business case around it all. All in four days. I don&apos;t expect to
          get much sleep.</para>

        <para>What can I say other than &quot;that was a very, very fast four days in Darmstadt&quot;. I had
          expected to have the time and energy to blog more during the event, but that was obviously
          not to be. There were only three people working on the actual code there, but we managed
          to make over 60 commits over the course of the event, not counting backports and similar
          janitorial efforts. That isn&apos;t a huge rate of commits given the people who were there,
          however, though it is certainly respectable. </para>
        <para>So what else were we doing? The first thing we did was review all open bugs for Plasma
          Active, turned our draft agenda into a kanban board on the wall and then torture tested
          the user interface on both MeeGo and OpenSUSE to identify issues that need addressing. We

          <ulink url="http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/01/review-of-opensuse-trademark-guidelines.html">Pascal Bleser: Review of openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink>
        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good
          balance between a few, most probably contradictory things:<itemizedlist>

          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been

            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

          applet is now working. It asks for authentication a bit too frequently - I do not think

          that systemd is being removed from <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</ulink> so that users won’t have a problem with it. That way it will allow

              users, I’m going to remove systemd from Tumbleweed today to allow the developers to
              spend more time on getting it stable for Factory and 12.1 instead of having to chase

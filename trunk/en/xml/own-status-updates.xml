      <para>When I started working on extending the <ulink url="http://susestudio.com/help/api/v2">SUSE Studio API</ulink> to support <ulink url="http://susegallery.com/">SUSE Gallery</ulink>, I developed a desktop client at the same time as a testbed. It&apos;s been a
        bit neglected over the last 6 months, as my <ulink url="http://www.entomologist-project.org/">primary after-work project</ulink> takes up a
        lot of my time, but it&apos;s usable nonetheless. In an effort to motivate me to work on it
        again, and to find other contributors, I&apos;m happy to announce the <ulink url="http://susegallery.sourceforge.net/">SUSE Gallery client</ulink>: </para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
      <para>With the Gallery client, you can browse, search, view details, download, write to a CD
        or USB key, or execute the image directly in a virtual machine. There&apos;s rudimentary support
        for connecting to Testdrive, but the built-in VNC client isn&apos;t very reliable , so don&apos;t be
        surprised if it doesn&apos;t work. Packages have been built for openSUSE and Fedora, but it
        should compile on any platform that Qt and LibVNCViewer support (including Windows and Mac).
        And of course, contributions and bug reports are most welcome!</para>

          Tuxies favorite boy group, but a bunch of people dedicated to help the openSUSE Project in
          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder
              how Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.</para>

            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

                >overview page</ulink> for the Factory project in OBS. It grew a bit more ambitions,

              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              7pm, because many community members showed up. Cool, I love that kind of stress to

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        <para>Sometime ago Gabriel asked me if I could give him help with the Banshee repositories

        <para>I’ve fixed the pending issues I’ve seen on the Banshee repository and Banshee 2.0.1
          and disabled SLE 11 builds (not requiring all the dependencies). The repository serves now

        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

          (unversioned :-)), the workspaces are called Plasma Desktop, Plasma Netbook, etc. Then we
          have the KDE development platform. In the future we will be referring to these as the

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good

          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in

            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

        </title>
        <para>Today we&#160;<ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/">released 3.4.0</ulink>,
          there is a great list of new features,&#160;<ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/3-4-new-features-and-fixes/">specific to LibreOffice</ulink>&#160;available (expertly assembled by Marc Pere and others). Each should
          also be credited so some of the depth of the (code) developer community is apparent, this
          is of course in addition to our extensive&#160;<ulink url="http://www.libreoffice.org/credits.html">credits page</ulink>&#160;(kept up to date by a
          volunteer of course). This is the first major release containing code from many of our new
          volunteers which is exciting. Of course, there are some great improvements there, I like
          the named range / data-pilot work that makes it easy to extend the data range you&apos;re
          working on without manually editing perhaps ten data-pilots depending on it but there are
          a load more. Some of the changes are invisible, and/or behind the scenes - so I thought
          I&apos;d expand on them here.</para>

        </title>
        <para>The Testing Core Team held an IRC meeting at 17:00 UTC, June 6 on our usual channel. </para>
        <para>We first discussed our experiences with 12.1-MS1. The KDE Live CD has the login
          problem (Bug #687781) and is nearly unusable. The bug report lists some workarounds. I
          used the Gnome Live CD for the initial install. When I added the KDE Desktop to that
          configuration, I could then log into the KDE desktop normally. </para>
        <para>Next, we discussed what might be changed to increase testing participation so that the
          workload might be diversified. We think there is increased testing with the RC1-2
          releases, but many of the bugs reported at this stage are not fixed by the time that the
          Gold Master is frozen. We realize that there is little opportunity to stretch the timing
          of the release schedule, thus we need to attract users at an earlier stage. As some
          testers might be reluctant to try the Milestone releases, we are proposing that MS6 be
          relabeled as a &quot;Beta&quot;. We would then have MS1-5, Beta, and RC1-2 as the stages. The
          relative timing of the steps would be the same, only that one stage would be renamed. </para>
        <para>Our next IRC meeting will be on June 27, 2011 at 17:00 UTC when we hope to be
          discussing MS2. </para>

        <para>Here&apos;s a short note as to the status of some recent activity in the
          openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the kernel is at the 2.6.38 release level tracking the upstream stable 2.6.38
              releases.</para>

            <para>KDE update seems stable and working. It&apos;s in the openSUSE:Tumbleweed:KDE repo if
              anyone wants to test it out now. I&apos;ll be working next few weeks to merge this into the
              main openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo as my bandwidth allows.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>There is a GNOME 3.0 Tumbleweed repo at openSUSE:Tumbleweed:GNOME. It&apos;s properly
              building right now, but the same caveats remain for the main GNOME 3.0 repo (i.e.
              network manager issues with KDE, and other minor stuff), so I can&apos;t merge it to the
              main openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo just yet. I&apos;ll wait for these changes to settle down,
              but if you want, feel free to try out the repo for your GNOME 3.0 systems running
              Tumbleweed. I&apos;ll keep it up to date as the changes merge into the main GNOME 3.0
              repo.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>artwork questions were raised with one proposed logo already sent in. More to come
              in this area hopefully soon.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>There were a few &quot;version downgrades&quot; that happened as the upstream project
              release number was changed to reflect the basesystem release number correctly. This
              will probably continue to happen as this change is propagated throughout the openSUSE
              build system to fix up these errors by the various developers. You can safely ignore
              them when they happen.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>As always, if anyone knows of any packages they wish to see added to Tumbleweed,
          please let me know.</para>
        <para>Please read the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed">wiki page for Tumbleweed</ulink> if you have any basic questions about what it is or how to use it.

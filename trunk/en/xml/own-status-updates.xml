      <para>Hello Mates. The last year was a great year. We had seen many funny things. The Relaunch
        of the openSUSE BuildService now provides many Features for packager. Then the
        kde-obs-generator makes the life easier for cross packaging. The openSUSE Conference was
        another interesting Highlight, and last but not least the sell of Novell. </para>
      <para>The openSUSE Weekly News Team searches the whole week for new things. Now we searching one
        or two new Contributors who are collecting news with us. In the past we have given one part
        of the news to one person, and that person was responsible for this part of the Weekly News.
        As Example you provide the Section &quot;Tips and Tricks&quot; so you can add and remove that Section
        what do you think is the best.</para>
      <para>ATM we can give the following Sections to a good Hand:</para>

        </title>
        <para>If you have the last Milestone of openSUSE, thats already number 5, installed then you
          can take a look into the history. You would see a dark splash as I planned them long time
          ago. You also see the KDM in the color I planned in August.</para>

        <para>2 weeks ago Coolo asked for some artwork for integrate it into the next Milestone, a
          weekend with lot of work, for Javier and me. After that some people woke up. First the KDE
          team wanted the color changed to celadon, whats also is the codename for 11.4. Thats ok
          for me, its there choice and it would be work with the grey what I planned for the GNOME
          side.</para>

        </mediaobject>
        <para>But now the GNOME team also want it changed. And that becomes now harder to do. There
          are some possibilities and also some borders for the work. Right now there is a little
          discussion on the mailinglist. But the default background of GNOME would be definitly not
          happen, he is nice but the blue works not with the celadon green tone. Also change that
          background to celadon green, wouldnt work because I have to choose one of the backgrounds
          for the bootsplash. Hope they find a solution I can work with. I would prefer a grey one,
          with a celadon geeko on it and change the green tone in sonar to celadon green
          also.</para>

        <para>I had a side project the last two weeks: Make the build service more fun to use. </para>
        <para>No matter how much fun you have creating packages, if they don’t build, there is
          little point in using a Service that has Build in its name, no? So one of the major goals
          of the service is actually to help those that want to build packages as good as possible.
          But there is a problem: </para>
        <para>Let me quote from the landing page of <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/">build.opensuse.org</ulink>: “The openSUSE Build Service hosts 16,414 projects, with
          107,691 packages, in 26,259 repositories and is used by 25,967 confirmed users.”. That are
          quite some high numbers – especially in the relation to the ~25 servers we have for
          actually building. </para>
        <para>If you look at the build statistics of the last month (and this is just i586, x86_64
          has around the same), you notice that there is not much purple in the “Busy workers / Idle
          workers” graphic:</para>

        <para>“Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.” // Peter F. Drucker</para>
        <para>This has been one of the guidelines in my life for quite some time… It started as a curiosity a long time ago with Notify OSD and evolved to full project 
          in openSUSE. It is important to acknowledge at this point the motivation provided by the openSUSE GNOME Team from which I’ve been getting plenty of guidance and 
          help, namely from Vincent Untz (vuntz) and Dominique ﻿Leuenberger (Dimstar). Thanks to them, we have now a GNOME:Ayatana Project on OBS (openSUSE Build Service), 
          currently being populated with the support libraries for Ayatana’s Unity and Indicators.</para>
        <para>Susan Linton has made a small article for Linux Journal about this project in the past. Though some people pointed to me that it was advertising and excelling 
          Ubuntu… I would like to leave a statement… We’re not taking a hike on Ubuntu visibility, and it isn’t bad at all, on the contrary… In fact it will help Ubuntu, us 
          and many others… specially if some Ubuntu patches are accepted faster by upstream. I hope other RPM distributions will follow the way we, openSUSE, proudly seem to 
          pioneering! From my personal point of view… a distribution ‘distributes’… and despite this software isn’t attractive for some openSUSE users, I’m happy it is 
          available (totally or partially) for all those who want to test it… Wait… you don’t even need to install Ubuntu or changing the platform you run!</para>
        <para>Due to several reasons, being the most important of them versioning, this repository will start on the next release of openSUSE in March 16th (World day 
        of Conscience, interesting point). This is also interesting as if YOU are willing to improve a package or submit a package you can now do it to this repository.</para>

        <para>Are you using the openSUSE KDE 4.6 Beta 2 packages and you would like to try a newer
          version ? Then for the time being you could switch over to the KDE:Unstable:SC repository. </para>
        <para>About 2 weeks ago, I copied the official KDE 4.6 Beta 2 packages over from the
          KDE:Distro:Factory repository to the KDE:Unstable:SC repository. This has two effects,
          namely: </para>
        <para>1) People using 4.6 Beta 2, can easily update to a slightly newer version to see if
          bugs have been resolved, without loosing important patches that are openSUSE specific. </para>
        <para>2) It gives us, the openSUSE KDE team the change to easier and faster adopt to a newer
          release (e.g. RC1, RC2, etc), as that all patches are matches on a weekly basis to the
          newer source code. </para>
        <para>If you decide to switch repository, then make sure that you keep an eye on this blog,
          as that on a certain moment the KDE:Unstable:SC will switch to very unstable snapshots of
          the future KDE 4.7. I will however blog here to let you know that you should switch back
          again repostories, before I will publish the first KDE 4.7 snapshot. </para>
        <para>Feel free to contact me over email or on IRC (tittiatcoke) if you have any questions
          about this. So far KDE 4.6 has been a very stable release and also KDEPIM 4.6 is looking
          better. Let’s hope that the last glitches are also resolved, before KDE 4.6 is released. </para>

          <para>&quot;I wanted to open a fate feature about this when I first heard of plymouth, but reading 
            http://fedoramagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/interview-fedora-10s-better-startup/ really makes me think we should go this way.</para>
          <para>Ray&apos;s comment starting with &quot;Every flicker and mode change in the boot process takes away from the whole experience.&quot; is especially interesting.

          <para>&quot;An easy way to remove Software! </para>
          <para>For example: you installed an application with &quot;1-click install&quot; (which
            will install all the packages that you need), there should be an easy way (also with 1
            click) to remove what you have installed with that 1-click operation... in another
            words: an &quot;1-click Uninstall&quot; to remove installed software (dependencies and
            packages included).&quot;</para>

        <para>As most of you are aware, openSUSE 11.4 Milestone 5 was released on schedule.
          Many of us have had a chance to test it, and found few problems. The only bug

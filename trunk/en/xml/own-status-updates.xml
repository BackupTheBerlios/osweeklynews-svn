        </title>
        <para>If you have the last Milestone of openSUSE, thats already number 5, installed then you
          can take a look into the history. You would see a dark splash as I planned them long time
          ago. You also see the KDM in the color I planned in August.</para>

        <para>2 weeks ago Coolo asked for some artwork for integrate it into the next Milestone, a
          weekend with lot of work, for Javier and me. After that some people woke up. First the KDE
          team wanted the color changed to celadon, whats also is the codename for 11.4. Thats ok
          for me, its there choice and it would be work with the grey what I planned for the GNOME
          side.</para>

        <para>But now the GNOME team also want it changed. And that becomes now harder to do. There
          are some possibilities and also some borders for the work. Right now there is a little
          discussion on the mailinglist. But the default background of GNOME would be definitly not
          happen, he is nice but the blue works not with the celadon green tone. Also change that
          background to celadon green, wouldnt work because I have to choose one of the backgrounds
          for the bootsplash. Hope they find a solution I can work with. I would prefer a grey one,
          with a celadon geeko on it and change the green tone in sonar to celadon green
          also.</para>

        <para>I had a side project the last two weeks: Make the build service more fun to use. </para>
        <para>No matter how much fun you have creating packages, if they don’t build, there is
          little point in using a Service that has Build in its name, no? So one of the major goals
          of the service is actually to help those that want to build packages as good as possible.
          But there is a problem: </para>
        <para>Let me quote from the landing page of <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/">build.opensuse.org</ulink>: “The openSUSE Build Service hosts 16,414 projects, with
          107,691 packages, in 26,259 repositories and is used by 25,967 confirmed users.”. That are
          quite some high numbers – especially in the relation to the ~25 servers we have for
          actually building. </para>
        <para>If you look at the build statistics of the last month (and this is just i586, x86_64
          has around the same), you notice that there is not much purple in the “Busy workers / Idle
          workers” graphic:</para>

        </title>
        <para>Are you using the openSUSE KDE 4.6 Beta 2 packages and you would like to try a newer
          version ? Then for the time being you could switch over to the KDE:Unstable:SC repository. </para>
        <para>About 2 weeks ago, I copied the official KDE 4.6 Beta 2 packages over from the
          KDE:Distro:Factory repository to the KDE:Unstable:SC repository. This has two effects,
          namely: </para>
        <para>1) People using 4.6 Beta 2, can easily update to a slightly newer version to see if
          bugs have been resolved, without loosing important patches that are openSUSE specific. </para>
        <para>2) It gives us, the openSUSE KDE team the change to easier and faster adopt to a newer
          release (e.g. RC1, RC2, etc), as that all patches are matches on a weekly basis to the
          newer source code. </para>
        <para>If you decide to switch repository, then make sure that you keep an eye on this blog,
          as that on a certain moment the KDE:Unstable:SC will switch to very unstable snapshots of
          the future KDE 4.7. I will however blog here to let you know that you should switch back
          again repostories, before I will publish the first KDE 4.7 snapshot. </para>
        <para>Feel free to contact me over email or on IRC (tittiatcoke) if you have any questions
          about this. So far KDE 4.6 has been a very stable release and also KDEPIM 4.6 is looking
          better. Let’s hope that the last glitches are also resolved, before KDE 4.6 is released. </para>

          </title>
          <para>&quot;Actually many distribution force scripts to have x privileges set. In KDE it will appear a dialog, when user try to run Desktop/Executable file.</para>
          <para>I think, that we should also add a way to write checksums and fingerprints to scripts/executables. User won&apos;t allow to run command if vendor are untrusted.&quot;</para>

            </title>
            <para>&quot;In openSUSE 11.0, when kernels were packaged, the developers used a -pae flag to show that the kernel had PAE enabled, so if I wanted a realtime kernel I could choose between kernel-rt and kernel-rtpae.
Now (from 11.2 up) it seems that all the kernels have PAE enabled, except kernel-default; and they are not marked as such, so kernel-rt STILL has PAE enabled. (...)&quot;</para>

            </title>
            <para>&quot;The partition manager allows backup and resotre of whole partitions, unfortunately it does a 1:1 copy, without compression.</para>
            <para>Compression would be great to save some disk space on the image.&quot;</para>

              <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311001">create a build-essential metapackage</ulink>
            </title>
            <para>&quot;This feature is a continuation of
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=657607 I agreed with J.W. that there should be a &quot;build-essential&quot; meta-package that depends on things like gcc, make, automake. Those are always pre-installed in OBS and thus missing from the explicit BuildRequires list of packages.
Currently, the exact list of implicit BuildRequires might only be known in the osc build script.</para>
            <para>This build-essential could then be fetched by &quot;zypper si PACKAGENAME&quot; and also be used in OBS to not have to maintain the list of packages in two places.&quot;</para>

            <para>&quot;I&apos;ve long been amazed about the speed of DamnSmallLinux on a low spec machine when run completely in RAM.
I&apos;ve also seen that this is possible with Gentoo and Ubuntu nowadays. (...)&quot;</para>

            <para>We have to create something specially related to openSUSE (not GNOME, not Kde...). One thing or several, something that makes people say &quot;wow!!&quot; (...)&quot;</para>

            </title>
            <para>&quot;Many users are frustrated, that OpenSUSE don&apos;t support He/She&apos;s native language well.
Allow to load native language files on system startup. Simply initramfs/initrd could load very base system, create ramdisk and asks to remove system CD them insert language support CD.
System will install packages with additional language onto ramdisk and asks to insert base system CD again.

</para>
            <para>After this process is performed, system will boot normally.&quot;</para>

        <para>The next Testing Core Team IRC meeting to discuss 11.4 Milestone 5 will be held
          December 27 at 1800 UTC.</para>
        <para>As most of you are aware, openSUSE 11.4 Milestone 5 was released on schedule.
          Many of us have had a chance to test it, and found few problems. The only bug
          added to the "most annoying" list is that zypper is slow on Live-installs (Bug
          #659864). There is a workaround.</para>
        <para>I repeat my plea for readers of these news to test, test, test, and and report
          all bugs to the Novell bugzilla.</para>
        <para>A very happy holiday for all.</para>

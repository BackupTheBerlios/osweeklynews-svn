      <para>Hello Mates. The last year was a great year. We had seen many funny things. The Relaunch
        of the openSUSE BuildService now provides many Features for packager. Then the
        kde-obs-generator makes the life easier for cross packaging. The openSUSE Conference was
        another interesting Highlight, and last but not least the sell of Novell. </para>
      <para>The openSUSE Weekly News Team searches the whole week for new things. Now we searching one
        or two new Contributors who are collecting news with us. In the past we have given one part
        of the news to one person, and that person was responsible for this part of the Weekly News.
        As Example you provide the Section &quot;Tips and Tricks&quot; so you can add and remove that Section
        what do you think is the best.</para>
      <para>ATM we can give the following Sections to a good Hand:</para>

        </title>
        <para>If you have the last Milestone of openSUSE, thats already number 5, installed then you
          can take a look into the history. You would see a dark splash as I planned them long time
          ago. You also see the KDM in the color I planned in August.</para>

        <para>2 weeks ago Coolo asked for some artwork for integrate it into the next Milestone, a
          weekend with lot of work, for Javier and me. After that some people woke up. First the KDE
          team wanted the color changed to celadon, whats also is the codename for 11.4. Thats ok
          for me, its there choice and it would be work with the grey what I planned for the GNOME
          side.</para>

        </mediaobject>
        <para>But now the GNOME team also want it changed. And that becomes now harder to do. There
          are some possibilities and also some borders for the work. Right now there is a little
          discussion on the mailinglist. But the default background of GNOME would be definitly not
          happen, he is nice but the blue works not with the celadon green tone. Also change that
          background to celadon green, wouldnt work because I have to choose one of the backgrounds
          for the bootsplash. Hope they find a solution I can work with. I would prefer a grey one,
          with a celadon geeko on it and change the green tone in sonar to celadon green
          also.</para>

          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder

            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

            <para>In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in

              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

            <para>openFATE, Connect and more</para>
            <para>After the conference and the release of 11.3 we started to dig into milestones

                url="http://connect.opensuse.org">Connect</ulink>. Since a couple of weeks we have a

              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>I had a side project the last two weeks: Make the build service more fun to use. </para>
        <para>No matter how much fun you have creating packages, if they don’t build, there is
          little point in using a Service that has Build in its name, no? So one of the major goals
          of the service is actually to help those that want to build packages as good as possible.
          But there is a problem: </para>
        <para>Let me quote from the landing page of <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/">build.opensuse.org</ulink>: “The openSUSE Build Service hosts 16,414 projects, with
          107,691 packages, in 26,259 repositories and is used by 25,967 confirmed users.”. That are
          quite some high numbers – especially in the relation to the ~25 servers we have for
          actually building. </para>
        <para>If you look at the build statistics of the last month (and this is just i586, x86_64
          has around the same), you notice that there is not much purple in the “Busy workers / Idle
          workers” graphic:</para>

        <para>This has been one of the guidelines in my life for quite some time… It started as a
          curiosity a long time ago with Notify OSD and evolved to full project in openSUSE. It is
          important to acknowledge at this point the motivation provided by the openSUSE GNOME Team
          from which I’ve been getting plenty of guidance and help, namely from Vincent Untz (vuntz)
          and Dominique ﻿Leuenberger (Dimstar). Thanks to them, we have now a GNOME:Ayatana Project
          on OBS (openSUSE Build Service), currently being populated with the support libraries for
          Ayatana’s Unity and Indicators.</para>
        <para>Susan Linton has made a small article for Linux Journal about this project in the
          past. Though some people pointed to me that it was advertising and excelling Ubuntu… I
          would like to leave a statement… We’re not taking a hike on Ubuntu visibility, and it
          isn’t bad at all, on the contrary… In fact it will help Ubuntu, us and many others…
          specially if some Ubuntu patches are accepted faster by upstream. I hope other RPM
          distributions will follow the way we, openSUSE, proudly seem to pioneering! From my
          personal point of view… a distribution <quote>distributes</quote>… and despite this
          software isn’t attractive for some openSUSE users, I’m happy it is available (totally or
          partially) for all those who want to test it… Wait… you don’t even need to install Ubuntu
          or changing the platform you run!</para>
        <para>Due to several reasons, being the most important of them versioning, this repository
          will start on the next release of openSUSE in March 16th (World day of Conscience,
          interesting point). This is also interesting as if YOU are willing to improve a package or
          submit a package you can now do it to this repository.</para>

        <para>Are you using the openSUSE KDE 4.6 Beta 2 packages and you would like to try a newer
          version ? Then for the time being you could switch over to the KDE:Unstable:SC repository. </para>
        <para>About 2 weeks ago, I copied the official KDE 4.6 Beta 2 packages over from the
          KDE:Distro:Factory repository to the KDE:Unstable:SC repository. This has two effects,
          namely: </para>
        <para>1) People using 4.6 Beta 2, can easily update to a slightly newer version to see if
          bugs have been resolved, without loosing important patches that are openSUSE specific. </para>
        <para>2) It gives us, the openSUSE KDE team the change to easier and faster adopt to a newer
          release (e.g. RC1, RC2, etc), as that all patches are matches on a weekly basis to the
          newer source code. </para>
        <para>If you decide to switch repository, then make sure that you keep an eye on this blog,
          as that on a certain moment the KDE:Unstable:SC will switch to very unstable snapshots of
          the future KDE 4.7. I will however blog here to let you know that you should switch back
          again repostories, before I will publish the first KDE 4.7 snapshot. </para>
        <para>Feel free to contact me over email or on IRC (tittiatcoke) if you have any questions
          about this. So far KDE 4.6 has been a very stable release and also KDEPIM 4.6 is looking
          better. Let’s hope that the last glitches are also resolved, before KDE 4.6 is released. </para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink
            url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of
            the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let's first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep them
          with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in practice,
          Novell's legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating such requests to
          the openSUSE board. </para>
        <!-- FIXME: Use the Email Element -->
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines"
            >openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen's feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let's take a step
          back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn't as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good
          balance between a few, most probably contradictory things:<itemizedlist>

          Leuenberger: Enlightenment 1.0.0 for openSUSE</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>It’s been a long time since I was in touch with Enlightenment, back in the young days I
        used it as my first alternative Desktop Environment on Windows, before actually daring to
        switch to Linux. </para>
      <para>Today I hear that version 1.0.0 of the core libraries have been released. Reason enough
        to actually look into this again. So 1 hour, many build failures and successes later, I have
        the entire core-stack built in my obs repository home:dimstar:Enlightenment. The window
        manager Enlightenment itself is not yet released as full release, but the latest snapshot
        can be found in my repo as well. </para>
      <para>But that’s it so far: all core libraries are built. Nothing more. I did not even have
        time to test them yet. </para>
      <para>If you feel adventurous, go, add the repository obs://home:dimstar:Enlightenment to your
        system (published for openSUSE 11.3 and Factory) and start playing with all of the things,
        starting with the window manager, which should generally pull in the rest. What should be
        required (as
        root)<screen>zypper ar obs://home:dimstar:Enlightenment Enlightenment
zypper in enlightenment</screen></para>
      <para>This will add my home repository to your catalog list and install enlightenment
        including dependencies. One logout later, you should see Enlightenment as a new session type
        in your *DM. </para>
      <para>Have a lot of fun and share your experiences… I will test it after I get some
        sleep.</para>

        I&apos;ve now updated my Drupal 7 appliances on <ulink url="http://susestudio.com/">SuSE Studio</ulink> to the latest release. The appliance is based on <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/113/en">openSUSE Linux 11.3</ulink> and is available in
        two variants:<itemizedlist>

      <para>The database backend is phpMyAdmin has been added to support web-based administration of
        the MySQL server. You can access it via http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/. I also added <ulink url="http://drush.ws/">drush</ulink>, the Drupal command line shell and scripting
        interface and some additional packages (yast2-http-server, bind-utils, php5-ctype, patch). I
        also bumped up the appliance&apos;s version number to 7.0.0, to match the version number of
        Drupal included. </para>
      <para>The appliance is available in various formats:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>

      <para>So congratulations to the Drupal developer community for reaching this goal and thanks
        to SuSE/Novell/Attachmate for providing the infrastructure for creating such appliances. I
        also would like to especially thank <ulink url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/rbos/">Richard Bos</ulink> for the testing and many suggestions for improvement of these
        appliances!</para>

          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder

            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a

                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>I just pushed a new osc feature to git master which allows you to edit a submit
          action. Use case: suppose you review a request (which has at least one submit action) and
          you find a small typo (for instance in the spec file) but except the typo everything is
          fine. So instead of declining the request you can fix the typo, create a new request
          (which contains the fix + the original changes), accept the newly created request and
          supersede the original request (that’s basically what osc does behind the scenes).</para>
        <para>Example:<screen>    # request with id 80 needs a small fix
    marcus@linux:~> osc rq show 80 –edit
    Request: #80

    submit:       home:Admin/foo  -> home:foobar/dest

            url="http://launchpad.net/synapse-project">synapse</ulink> available for openSUSE or
          what was required to have it around. I took a look into it and asked some advice in
          #opensuse-gnome regarding the availability of libzeitgeist which is one of the
          requirements to build this piece of software.</para>
        <para>Some time ago Federico Quintero has posted a <ulink
            url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-gnome/2011-01/msg00016.html">message</ulink> on
          the opensuse-gnome mailing list regarding his work on the Zeitgeist stack. The rest of the
          dependencies for this package are provided by my work on the availability of Ubuntu’s
          software on openSUSE. From my work I took <ulink url="http://launchpad.net/dee"
            >dee</ulink> and <ulink url="http://launchpad.net/libappindicator"
            >libappindicator</ulink> and builded a test package of synapse on <ulink
            url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-gnome/2011-01/msg00020.html"
            >home:ketheriel:ayatana</ulink>. This package is here until I see this dependencies hit
          factory on time (libzeitgeist, dee and libappindicator). If anyone wants to test it out,
          go ahead.</para>

        <para>I’m not sure of the functionality that should be present on this vala application, but
          for the time being I’ve disabled the Application Indicator on the build (needs hammering
          on the linking). I’ll take a closer look once I have some more free time. So far this
          should be working only for openSUSE Factory and openSUSE 11.4 milestones. </para>
        <para>Synapse is a semantic file launcher (pretty much the same as hitting ALT+F2 on a GNOME
          session) with some crazy looks and a battalion of plugins. Once the dependencies are ok,
          I’ll maintain this package and push it to the GNOME:Apps repository.</para>

        </title>
        <para>It’s been a while and there was nothing special to report, KDE SC 4.5 just worked. In
          the meantime KDE SC 4.6 was released and openSUSE offers it in <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/KDE_repositories">KDF as well as KR46 repos</ulink>. Big
          thanks to everybody who is involved in establishing and maintaining those repos – openSUSE
          really profits a lot from the (openSUSE-)KDE community that makes it possible to provide
          such a nice and updated KDE distro. </para>
        <para>Those updating from KDE 4.4 which came with openSUSE 11.3 to 4.6 – please save your
          plasma* files from ~/.kde4/share/config in case plasma crashes after the update.
          Submitting them to Novell’s bugzilla would be much appreciated in order to get those
          crashes fixed for openSUSE 11.4. The same applies to all other issues that come up when
          updating KDE 4.4 to 4.6, e.g. kdepim-related. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE SC 4.6</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>KDE 4.6 has some nice fixes, among them <ulink url="http://bugs.kde.org/163707">bko
            bug 163707</ulink> which prevented KDE from restoring the resolution set in
          systemsettings on login. This is especially important to openSUSE users since sax2 is gone
          and display settings moved into the desktop environment. Plasma seems to become more
          stable with every release – in fact I did not have any major issues with it since ages and
          bug fixing is pretty fast as well. Dolphin does also not suffer from buggy dbus packages
          anymore and with the latest strigi packages I do not encounter any crashes on close or
          when hovering certain files which did crash dolphin before. Thanks to remur_030 who helped
          the strigi people tracking the latter down for .msi files and thereby found and fixed some
          general issue in strigi which could cause crashes. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Desktop search </emphasis></para>
        <para>The desktop search does still not justify its name though since basics are still
          missing, e.g. context given for search results as all other desktop searches do and kerry
          + beagle already did years ago. <ulink
            url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/someone-requested-excerpts-for-query-results/"
            >The feature was shown some months ago</ulink> but is not as such available in KDE 4.6 –
          thus even in KDE 4.6 all the user gets is a replacement of kfind + tagging which needs a
          huge database for that simple task. </para>
        <para>On top of that there are still issues with <ulink
            url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246678">virtuoso-t hogging the CPU</ulink>,
          its database never decreasing in size but only increasing, even if you remove folders from
          the “to be indexed”-list and the systray-tool used to suspend the indexing vanished as
          well decreasing transparency to the user of an app which potentially keeps your hard disk
          and CPU busy. </para>
        <para>Yes, I know there is always a shortage of manpower but IMHO if an app fails to provide
          the very basic features regarding the functionality its name advertises, it will not gain
          any acceptance among users and since every xth user is also a developer it will not
          attract developers either. Thus the extent of this manpower shortage is self-imposed in
          case of nepomuk aka desktop search. </para>
        <para>I think its a bit unfortunate that strigi is always blamed for anything related to the
          desktop search in KDE although it is just the tool that is used by nepomuk and its usage
          is up to nepomuk and not strigi itself, i.e. when to start hammering the hard disk, how to
          handle the results within a database, what results to display when searching, giving the
          user control and information regarding its activities etc. From my experience strigi devs
          are quite responsive regarding bugs and questions – although their websites are all pretty
          much outdated. :) </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 there is still one major mystery bug to solve for openSUSE 32-bit
          NVIDIA users which get <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251719">several
            apps crashing since they updated to KDE >= 4.5</ulink>. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Power-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Power-management got worse in KDE 4.6, regressions such as not disabling
          powermanagement on desktops and thus suspending the display every 10 minutes, the
          brigtness slider not representing 100% of the brightness supported by the notebook and it
          still messes with the brightness the user has set. All these were reported some weeks ago
          already. Let’s hope that KDE SC 4.6.1 fixes those since that seems to be the version that
          openSUSE 11.4 will ship. </para>
        <para>Further having a presentation-scheme (no suspend, no dimming etc.) is kind of useless
          with KDE 4.6 since it will change to the next scheme if the battery hits any limit. Thus
          you have to permanently watch the status and switch back to the presentation-scheme to be
          save of a suspending notebook while you watch a movie within the presentation or during
          some longer discussion which leads to you not moving the mouse for some minutes. </para>
        <para>Ignoring the scheme the user manually set does indeed make sense but only for the last
          5% of your battery and in order to avoid the notebook just turning off because there was
          no power left. </para>
        <para>openSUSE 11.4 milestones also features a powermanagement bug that makes your hard disk
          suspend every few minutes, confirmed but no fix so far. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Package-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 we are currently <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_packagekit">testing
            kpackagekit/apper</ulink> as a replacement for the unmaintained kupdateapplet.
          Kpackagekit works ok but it seems that its zypper backend could need some improvements.
          And the next version of kpackagekit which will be called apper features monochrome systray
          icons which is fine, but the “security patch available” signal is just a tiny red dot
          which is hardly visible, especially if your eye-sight is not the best or you are suffering
          red-green colour blindness. So most issues with kpackagekit are not actually kpackagekit’s
          fault but either backend-related or touching artists’ taste. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Phonon-backends</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Another application <ulink
            url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_phonon-backend">to test is the
            phonon-backend</ulink> to be used in openSUSE 11.4 by default. Should we stay with xine
          whose backend is apparently unmaintained but has served most users well, switch to the
          vlc-backend or maybe use the gstreamer-backend? </para>
        <para>Trying to play some file with amarok and the gstreamer-backend brings up some dialogue
          (/usr/lib/gst-install-plugins-helper) that asks whether it should search for some package,
          I guess codecs. If one clicks on “search” kpackagekit opens up and claims instantly that
          “Getting what provides” finished but does not do anything. This is on 11.3 plus KDE 4.6
          from KDF, so let’s hope it works better on 11.4. </para>
        <para>The vlc-backend consumes the double amount of CPU for playing the same mp3 via amarok.
          8% instead of 4% might not be that much in absolute terms but a 100% waste nonetheless and
          especially on mobile devices everything that wastes battery should be avoided. Further
          there seem to be issues playing video via vlc, some apps like dragonplayer. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE-PIM </emphasis></para>
        <para>And finally there is of course the always present issue of KDE-PIM. openSUSE 11.4 will
          ship kdepim 4.4.10 which needs testing. There is especially <ulink
            url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185544">one annoying bug which makes kontact
            crash</ulink> when logging in if the last view before logging out was kmail. So let’s
          hope this can be fixed before 11.4 gets released.</para>
        <para>I was really looking forward to KDE-PIM 4.6 since IMAP-support seems a lot better with
          akonadi, at least for my use-cases which include suspending/resuming. The latter makes
          KDE-PIM 4.4′s imap slave fail and not recover which works fine with KDE-PIM 4.6. You can
          get regularly updated packages for the latter off openSUSE’s UNSTABLE KDE repo. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Help testing </emphasis></para>
        <para>Please help testing KDE SC 4.6 from the openSUSE repos in order to make it shine in
          openSUSE 11.4. Feedback can go to the related wiki pages or straight to
          opensuse-kde@.</para>

          is that the KDE project released 4.6.0 yesterday. Naturally, we’ve got it available for
          download for all current openSUSE releases as we prepare 4.6 for openSUSE 11.4. 4.6 brings
          better performance and improved power management control to the Plasma workspaces. The KDE
          4.6 application releases include features such as navigation capabilities in the Marble
          map app, more ways to search your files in Dolphin, and photo sharing via social networks.
          KDE 4.6.0 is currently available in the KDE:Distro:Factory repositories. A KDE:Release:46
          repository will shortly be made available, providing the point releases in the KDE 4.6
          series.</para>

          packaged KOffice 2.3.1 including the realistic natural medium paint app, Krita. KDevelop

        <para>The team continues to work to prepare openSUSE 11.4. The openSUSE updater applet is

          the range of Phonon sound system options for the best audio experience when 11.4 is
          released. All dependencies on the old HAL system for hardware in KDE have now been
          replaced with udev, and have received a lot of testing. KSynaptiks has been configured by
          default to allow touchpad taps, but disable the touchpad when typing. And the team has

            Slicing up the Web</ulink>
        </title>
        <para>The Webslice applet has been in Plasma (kdeplasma-addons, to be precise) since 4.4
          already. It allows the user to display a part of a webpage on the desktop. This can be
          useful for monitoring only a specific part of a webpage, or just to display something
          nice. </para>
        <para>The Webslice applet has been written by Richard Moore and me as a functional
          prototype, but didn’t see much love since it was added to Plasma for 4.4 in 2009. Its
          basic mechanism is that you specify a “slice” within a website, which is a rectangular
          region. This region then gets shown in the applet, and resizes dynamically with it,
          zooming the “slice” in and out. The widget basically worked, but had two significant
          problems: Resizing was very sluggish and bound to a kept aspect ratio, and you needed to
          know CSS2 selector syntax to actually use it. </para>
        <para>Earlier tonight, I’ve committed a set of changes which address these problems, and
          backported them after review on the plasma-devel mailing list to the 4.6 branch, so these
          changes become part of Plasma 4.6.1, which will be the first service and translation
          update to 4.6.0, which we released yesterday.</para>

        <para>First, the resize issue. The Webslice applet <xref linkend="fig.performance"/> uses a
          webkit view, which displays the page and is positioned (basically scrolled with scrollbars
          switched off) and zoomed to fit into the area the applet covers — fairly simple in fact.
          The performance problem was caused by too much resizing which got passed down the stack
          (if you scroll and zoom a website every couple of milliseconds, it becomes quite heavy on
          the CPU easily. I’ve addressed this by cleaning up the codepathes that lead to resizing,
          so that it only causes the resize (and thus the repositioning and zoom of the webpage)
          when absolutely necessary. Resize events from the applet are now compressed a bit, so that
          we don’t get more than 10 resizes a second. That’s “good enough” for the user to see what
          effect his mouse-dragging has, but doesn’t have the sluggish effect. Then, while resizing,
          I’m freezing webkit’s tiled backing store, for an additional performance boost. The result
          is very noticeable, the lag and CPU-hogging while resizing is gone, and the sizing of the
          applet is much less unwieldy with these changes. In that process, I’ve also switched to a
          non-fixed aspect ratio. Bug #1 thoroughly fixed. </para>

        <para>Next-up, slice selection. As I already mentioned, that was neither easy, nor
          user-friendly. (If you’re running, 4.4+, give it a shot, it really sucks ;-).) First off,
          you need to know CSS2 selectors (they’re quite easy, in most cases you want #myid for an
          element in the page being marked with id=”myid”), but still limit the utility of the
          widget to a rather select group. (Does this make the widget 1337?)I’ve been pondering how
          to best offer this to the user. It should be easy to pick a slice from all the elements
          that are there. The first thing I did was to turn the lineedit where you’d input the CSS
          selector (#myid or whatever) into an editable combobox, already containing elements to
          choose from. That made picking a slice much more “determistic”. Still, the #myid names are
          not always telling you what part of the page their actually displaying, so some more
          feedback is desirable. My approach there is the following: When the user opens the
          configuration dialog <xref linkend="fig.improving"/>, the page is zoomed out and fully
          shown in the webslice applet, it switches to a preview mode. The user can now enter a
          different URL, and temporary load this in the slice applet. The combo box containing the
          elements is now updated to contain the elements of the new page. Website picked, now let’s
          pick a slice. By selecting a slice from the combobox, the preview mode highlights the
          position of the currently selected slice in the widget. You apply and it zooms in there. A
          nice touch is that you can “scroll” through the slice by hovering over the combobox, or
          flip through them using the arrow keys while focusing the combobox. All in all, not quite
          unintrusive changes, but considering the widget wasn’t of much use due to above described
          problems anyway (there was one bug filed against it — likely a bad sign, I’m not that good
          a hacker). Marco and Aaron were kind enough to review the patches and agreed that they
          won’t hurt much, but do provide a nice set of improvements we’d like our users to get
          fairly quickly, not just next summer with 4.7. </para>
        <para>There are a couple of loose ends left for 4.7, though. As I wanted to keep the
          possibility of a backport open, I’ve not changed any strings in the widget, adding an
          explaining tooltip here or there might be useful, but also some more flexible sizing
          options (what proportions to use for the initial rendering — that matters for fluid
          layouts, how to clip if the size of the widget doesn’t match the aspect ratio of the
          slice, etc. I’ve chosen “sane defaults” for these things now, but it’ll probably be nice
          having that available as an option to the user. </para>

        </para>
        <para>There’s one neat thing left to tell about the webslice: You can easily create your own
          preconfigured slices. In order to do that, copy and rename the .desktop file, change name,

          <ulink url="http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2011/01/review-of-opensuse-trademark-guidelines.html">Pascal Bleser: Review of openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink>
        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good
          balance between a few, most probably contradictory things:<itemizedlist>

                derivative works based on openSUSE (but the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">current guidelines</ulink>, which the board has to abide by, do not really reflect

          cases that we want to enable and support and what you believe would be cases of abuse,
          especially if you have been involved or have been pondering about making a derivative of
          openSUSE or, more generally, use the openSUSE trademarks in one way or another. </para>

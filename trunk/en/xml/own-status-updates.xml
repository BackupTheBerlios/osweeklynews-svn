          >Tejas Guruswamy: redshift and backintime in Factory</ulink>
      </title>
      <para>Well, it's been a long while since my last news ... but I've got some nice news to
        report - my submissions of redshift and backintime were accepted into openSUSE Factory. So
        these useful programs will be part of the next openSUSE release, hooray!</para>
      <para><ulink url="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">Redshift</ulink> is a little command-line (and
        GTK) utility which reduces screen brightness at night (via colour temperature, so your
        screen becomes more red). Given your location in the world, it automatically calculates
        sunset and sunrise and gradually ramps up/down the brightness at the right times. I find it
        makes working at night easier on the eyes, and wrote a little plasmoid to control it easily
        from the desktop, which I will also release when I get some time. For previous openSUSE
        versions one can download and install redshift from its OBS devel project, <ulink
          url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/Utilities"
        >X11:Utilities</ulink>.</para>
      <para><ulink url="http://backintime.le-web.org/">Backintime</ulink> is a backup program,
        effectively a rsync frontend, with GUIs for KDE and GNOME. Once configured with which
        folders you want to back up, and where you want to back up to, it can automatically take
        backups based on a schedule. Also a very nice feature is that on filesystems that support it
        (not FAT), it uses hardlinks to the previous backup, so each backup is a full backup but
        only changed files take up space on the backup disk. Each backup is just a normal copy of
        all the folders, so no special software is needed for recovery, but backintime offers a GUI
        that allows you to easily navigate through all your backed up versions of a folder. IMO it's
        the best userfriendly but complete backup software for Linux desktops. backintime used to be
        packaged by packman and now lives on the OBS in <ulink
          url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving:/Backup/"

        /></para>
      <para>Enjoy! If you have other interesting programs that aren't in openSUSE remember that
        anyone can contribute to Factory now, so if you are willing to maintain them, go ahead and
        submit them on the OBS! My next target is byobu, a set of preconfigured GNU screen profiles
        (I never figured out how to write hardstatus lines!) </para>

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">A bit of history: from Coolo &amp; Dirk to TWG to Release
            Team</emphasis></para>
        <para>In KDE 3, Coolo and Dirk managed KDE’s releases. When KDE4 was started, we also wanted
          to promote this in a more suitable fashion, we started doing more proactive PR work, and
          generally improved our communication to our users (potential or not). In 2005, the
          Technical Working Group was conceived, which was meant to handle the releases of KDE4. The
          Technical Working Group didn’t quite work out since it didn’t bring the structural changes
          we needed in order to release KDE4. In late 2006 we we decided that it didn’t work,
          disbanded the TWG and conceived the release team, a self-organized team of volunteers.
          Conceptually, the release team started as a place for people to go who wanted to make
          releases happen. We found module maintainers for our released modules who would coordinate
          towards the app teams and, and a few core people who know how all that stuff works to put
          things together. We got our release process on the rails again. Interestingly, the release
          team is very informal, we never ended up appointing anyone release manager, or
          end-responsible — it has also never been necessary, it seems. Lesson here: shared
          responsibility works well for us.</para>
        <para>A quick unscientific count of the whole KDE 4 series (including pre-releases) brought
          me to 88 releases done by the release team in its current form.</para>

        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for

          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

            <para>There were a few &quot;version downgrades&quot; that happened as the upstream project
              release number was changed to reflect the basesystem release number correctly. This
              will probably continue to happen as this change is propagated throughout the openSUSE
              build system to fix up these errors by the various developers. You can safely ignore
              them when they happen.</para>

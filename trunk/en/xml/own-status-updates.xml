      </title>
      <para>We finally managed to make the legal review steps transparent. So if you submit a
        package now to factory, a &quot;legal-auto&quot; group is asked to review it - this is done by a
        script of Jýrgen, which checks if the package was reviewed before. If not, a &quot;legal-team&quot;
        group is asked to review.</para>
      <para>So the requests no longer appear to be ignored. In future we plan to do the same with
        some check-auto and check-manual to review build status and basic checks as soon as
        possible.</para>
      <para>Greetings, Stephan P.S. Right now we can&apos;t publish new builds as kiwi requires a package
        that does not exist ;(</para>

          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder
              how Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

            <para>In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in
              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

                <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE Conference</ulink>.
              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>openFATE, Connect and more</para>
            <para>After the conference and the release of 11.3 we started to dig into milestones
              again with <ulink url="http://features.opensuse.org">openFATE</ulink> and <ulink
                url="http://connect.opensuse.org">Connect</ulink>. Since a couple of weeks we have a
              nice looking openFATE that has the features that make it possible for the feature
              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>It’s been a while and there was nothing special to report, KDE SC 4.5 just worked. In
          the meantime KDE SC 4.6 was released and openSUSE offers it in <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/KDE_repositories">KDF as well as KR46 repos</ulink>. Big
          thanks to everybody who is involved in establishing and maintaining those repos – openSUSE
          really profits a lot from the (openSUSE-)KDE community that makes it possible to provide
          such a nice and updated KDE distro. </para>
        <para>Those updating from KDE 4.4 which came with openSUSE 11.3 to 4.6 – please save your
          plasma* files from ~/.kde4/share/config in case plasma crashes after the update.
          Submitting them to Novell’s bugzilla would be much appreciated in order to get those
          crashes fixed for openSUSE 11.4. The same applies to all other issues that come up when
          updating KDE 4.4 to 4.6, e.g. kdepim-related. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE SC 4.6</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>KDE 4.6 has some nice fixes, among them <ulink url="http://bugs.kde.org/163707">bko bug 163707</ulink> which prevented KDE from restoring the resolution set in
          systemsettings on login. This is especially important to openSUSE users since sax2 is gone
          and display settings moved into the desktop environment. Plasma seems to become more
          stable with every release – in fact I did not have any major issues with it since ages and
          bug fixing is pretty fast as well. Dolphin does also not suffer from buggy dbus packages
          anymore and with the latest strigi packages I do not encounter any crashes on close or
          when hovering certain files which did crash dolphin before. Thanks to remur_030 who helped
          the strigi people tracking the latter down for .msi files and thereby found and fixed some
          general issue in strigi which could cause crashes. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Desktop search </emphasis></para>
        <para>The desktop search does still not justify its name though since basics are still
          missing, e.g. context given for search results as all other desktop searches do and kerry
          + beagle already did years ago. <ulink url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/someone-requested-excerpts-for-query-results/">The feature was shown some months ago</ulink> but is not as such available in KDE 4.6 –
          thus even in KDE 4.6 all the user gets is a replacement of kfind + tagging which needs a
          huge database for that simple task. </para>
        <para>On top of that there are still issues with <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246678">virtuoso-t hogging the CPU</ulink>,
          its database never decreasing in size but only increasing, even if you remove folders from
          the “to be indexed”-list and the systray-tool used to suspend the indexing vanished as
          well decreasing transparency to the user of an app which potentially keeps your hard disk
          and CPU busy. </para>
        <para>Yes, I know there is always a shortage of manpower but IMHO if an app fails to provide
          the very basic features regarding the functionality its name advertises, it will not gain
          any acceptance among users and since every xth user is also a developer it will not
          attract developers either. Thus the extent of this manpower shortage is self-imposed in
          case of nepomuk aka desktop search. </para>
        <para>I think its a bit unfortunate that strigi is always blamed for anything related to the
          desktop search in KDE although it is just the tool that is used by nepomuk and its usage
          is up to nepomuk and not strigi itself, i.e. when to start hammering the hard disk, how to
          handle the results within a database, what results to display when searching, giving the
          user control and information regarding its activities etc. From my experience strigi devs
          are quite responsive regarding bugs and questions – although their websites are all pretty
          much outdated. :) </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 there is still one major mystery bug to solve for openSUSE 32-bit
          NVIDIA users which get <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251719">several apps crashing since they updated to KDE &gt;= 4.5</ulink>. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Power-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Power-management got worse in KDE 4.6, regressions such as not disabling
          powermanagement on desktops and thus suspending the display every 10 minutes, the
          brigtness slider not representing 100% of the brightness supported by the notebook and it
          still messes with the brightness the user has set. All these were reported some weeks ago
          already. Let’s hope that KDE SC 4.6.1 fixes those since that seems to be the version that
          openSUSE 11.4 will ship. </para>
        <para>Further having a presentation-scheme (no suspend, no dimming etc.) is kind of useless
          with KDE 4.6 since it will change to the next scheme if the battery hits any limit. Thus
          you have to permanently watch the status and switch back to the presentation-scheme to be
          save of a suspending notebook while you watch a movie within the presentation or during
          some longer discussion which leads to you not moving the mouse for some minutes. </para>
        <para>Ignoring the scheme the user manually set does indeed make sense but only for the last
          5% of your battery and in order to avoid the notebook just turning off because there was
          no power left. </para>
        <para>openSUSE 11.4 milestones also features a powermanagement bug that makes your hard disk
          suspend every few minutes, confirmed but no fix so far. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Package-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 we are currently <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_packagekit">testing kpackagekit/apper</ulink> as a replacement for the unmaintained kupdateapplet.
          Kpackagekit works ok but it seems that its zypper backend could need some improvements.
          And the next version of kpackagekit which will be called apper features monochrome systray
          icons which is fine, but the “security patch available” signal is just a tiny red dot
          which is hardly visible, especially if your eye-sight is not the best or you are suffering
          red-green colour blindness. So most issues with kpackagekit are not actually kpackagekit’s
          fault but either backend-related or touching artists’ taste. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Phonon-backends</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Another application <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_phonon-backend">to test is the phonon-backend</ulink> to be used in openSUSE 11.4 by default. Should we stay with xine
          whose backend is apparently unmaintained but has served most users well, switch to the
          vlc-backend or maybe use the gstreamer-backend? </para>
        <para>Trying to play some file with amarok and the gstreamer-backend brings up some dialogue
          (/usr/lib/gst-install-plugins-helper) that asks whether it should search for some package,
          I guess codecs. If one clicks on “search” kpackagekit opens up and claims instantly that
          “Getting what provides” finished but does not do anything. This is on 11.3 plus KDE 4.6
          from KDF, so let’s hope it works better on 11.4. </para>
        <para>The vlc-backend consumes the double amount of CPU for playing the same mp3 via amarok.
          8% instead of 4% might not be that much in absolute terms but a 100% waste nonetheless and
          especially on mobile devices everything that wastes battery should be avoided. Further
          there seem to be issues playing video via vlc, some apps like dragonplayer. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE-PIM </emphasis></para>
        <para>And finally there is of course the always present issue of KDE-PIM. openSUSE 11.4 will
          ship kdepim 4.4.10 which needs testing. There is especially <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185544">one annoying bug which makes kontact crash</ulink> when logging in if the last view before logging out was kmail. So let’s
          hope this can be fixed before 11.4 gets released.</para>
        <para>I was really looking forward to KDE-PIM 4.6 since IMAP-support seems a lot better with
          akonadi, at least for my use-cases which include suspending/resuming. The latter makes
          KDE-PIM 4.4′s imap slave fail and not recover which works fine with KDE-PIM 4.6. You can
          get regularly updated packages for the latter off openSUSE’s UNSTABLE KDE repo. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Help testing </emphasis></para>
        <para>Please help testing KDE SC 4.6 from the openSUSE repos in order to make it shine in
          openSUSE 11.4. Feedback can go to the related wiki pages or straight to
          opensuse-kde@.</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>

            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs

        <para>The <emphasis role="italic">3.3.2</emphasis> release is in a very good shape, so we
          decided to slow down the bug fixes release cycle. You might expect the <emphasis role="italic">3.3.3</emphasis> bug fix release two months from now.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">LO-3.4</emphasis> feature freeze is pretty close and we will
          start producing test packages in the <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/">LibreOffice:Unstable</ulink> project. Please, be patient because there are many
          interesting changes in the build framework. They are good for the future but I expect some
          problems with packaging. I hope that I will manage to provide something by the end of
          April.</para>

        <para>The Testing Core Team held an IRC meeting on March 28, 2011 at 17:00 UTC. We discussed
          our plans for the next &quot;Open Bugs Day&quot;, which will be from 00:00 to 23:59 UTC, Saturday
          April 2, 2011. As written before, the emphasis will be on identifying those bugs reported
          for 11.2 and older that are still present in 11.4. We will not attempt to squash these
          bugs, but to make sure that none have been forgotten. After the release of 11.5 M5, we
          will have a bug-squashing day. </para>
        <para>As I write this, OBD has started. I&apos;m not sure when this will be published, but if it
          is still April 2, then please join us at irc://irc.opensuse.org/openSUSE-testing. </para>

        <para> From the next Issue (170) it will be easier to read the Weekly News. <ulink url="https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/profile/thomas-schraitle">Thomas Schraitle</ulink>
          yesterday has implemented the <ulink url="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/index.php?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=5298&amp;group_id=12095">Feature Request #5298</ulink>. The Main Goal of that was to integrate <emphasis role="underline">a Navigations Bar</emphasis> for the Weekly News.</para>
        <para> Now the first implementation looks like:</para>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata width="40%" fileref="http://saigkill.homelinux.net/images/NavBar.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>So you can skip a Section who you are not interested in.</para>
        <para>If you have a new Feature you want to have implemented in the Weekly News, just visit
          our <ulink url="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=12095">Feature-Request SIte</ulink> on BerliOS. ATM this feature is just implemented in the HTML
          Version.</para>

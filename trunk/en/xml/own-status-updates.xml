      </title>
      <para>We finally managed to make the legal review steps transparent. So if you submit a
        package now to factory, a &quot;legal-auto&quot; group is asked to review it - this is done by a
        script of Jýrgen, which checks if the package was reviewed before. If not, a &quot;legal-team&quot;
        group is asked to review.</para>
      <para>So the requests no longer appear to be ignored. In future we plan to do the same with
        some check-auto and check-manual to review build status and basic checks as soon as
        possible.</para>
      <para>Greetings, Stephan P.S. Right now we can&apos;t publish new builds as kiwi requires a package
        that does not exist ;(</para>

          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder
              how Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

            <para>In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in
              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>Today, I’d like to announce to a wider audience a project we have been working on in
          and beyond the Plasma team. Its goal is to “<emphasis role="bold">Create a desirable user
            experience encompassing a spectrum of devices</emphasis>“, and it is called <emphasis
            role="bold">Plasma Active</emphasis>. A couple of things make Plasma Active special.
          First, the driver is the <emphasis role="italic">desirable user experience</emphasis>.
          That means that we want to create something, people want, and people want to use. It means
          we are less technology-focused, but are taken a user-centered approach. Second, we are not
          targeting a single device, or a narrowly-defined class of devices. Plasma Active is made
          to run on a <emphasis role="italic">spectrum of devices</emphasis> that make up the user
          experience together. Devices change, and so does the way the user interacts with them. By
          strongly separating data and visualisation / interaction, we do not re-invent the wheel
          but adapt to the requirements and expectations of a device, and about how devices work
          together for the user.</para>

        <para>There is still a long way to go. We’re missing key functionality, default
          applications, optimizations all over the place, and more. There is nothing fundamental
          that holds us back to bringing the full experience users expect to tablet devices, based
          on our well-known, beloved, proven software stack. We are focusing our first release,
          which is planned for September already, on tablet computers. Since fixing a bunch of
          showstoppers over the past two weeks, I’ve actually started using Plasma Active for some
          light reading tasks (mostly web and RSS), and I’ve got to say: It rocks your socks. Being
          able to use a tablet computer which is based on Free software that you created yourself,
          is real fun. I’ve also handed it to friends who came by, and while they understood it’s an
          early prototype, I had a really hard time getting my gadget back. And that is only just
          the beginning. We have an excellent base to build a complete experience upon. In other
          words, it’s the perfect time to jump in and become part of something great and to help it
          also making it something really big.</para>

            >rethink</ulink> some of our collaboration processes. One of my pet peeves has always
          been that different essential parts of what the user gets in her hands come from different
          teams. If we want to put something desirable into the hands of our users we need to pull
          in the same direction. While we needed different skills, these skills have to align in how
          they’re applied. This makes communication more natural, leads to a more focused process,
          and ultimately a better result. It’s clear that such an endeavour will only work if enough
          people in our communities, and the communities around it think that this is a worthwhile
          thing to spend their time on, and that we can get the people that do to pull in the same
          direction. The good news, however is that we’ve been able to create a stable platform to
          do this, in terms of tools, processes, collaboration models and not at least software.
          That platform is <ulink url="http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active"><emphasis role="bold"

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good
          balance between a few, most probably contradictory things:<itemizedlist>

            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping

        <para>The Testing Core Team will meet on Monday, April 11 at 17:00 UTC on our usual IRC
          channel. We will be discussing the Open Bugs Day that was held on Saturday April 2. In
          addition, we will have a post-release discussion of 11.4 to emphasize what was good, and
          what might be improved during the development of 12.1 between now and its release in
          November 2011. </para>
        <para>There was limited participation in Open Bugs Day, with many fewer workers than the
          previous OBD. We are not sure of the reasons. Perhaps our target of bugs from 11.2 and
          older versions did not attract as much interest as the previous effort, when we targeted
          bugs in 11.4. In addition, last Saturday was reported to be a very nice spring day in
          Nuremberg and that some potential participants chose to be outside rather than sitting at
          a computer terminal. Despite the relatively few participants, we updated a large number of
          bugs. Our tool at <ulink url="http://openbugs.zq1.de/">http://openbugs.zq1.de/</ulink>
          found a total of 1179 open bugs for versions up to 11.2. Of these, 365 were updated in the
          Bugzilla pages. Some of these were really old. For example, I found several bugs still
          open from versions 10.0 and 10.1!</para>

        <para>Here's a short note as to the status of some recent activity in the
          openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo:</para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>I'm considering adding GNOME:3.0 to openSUSE:Tumbleweed when the openSUSE GNOME
              developers release it. It's building in a test repository right now pretty
              successfully, but it might be a few more weeks until it seems "ready" enough.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Note, it seems that when <emphasis role="italic">any</emphasis> package is added or
          updated in the openSUSE:Tumbleweed repository, LibreOffice rebuilds itself. This can be
          annoying for those on bandwidth-challenged network connections, and seems to be due to the
          dependency chain that the LibreOffice developers have defined in their .spec files.
          Hopefully this will be resolved for the next major release, but in the meantime, I'll try
          to limit library updates in openSUSE:Tumbleweed to once a week at the most unless security
          issues require it.</para>
        <para>Please read the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed">wiki page for
            Tumbleweed</ulink> if you have any basic questions about what it is or how to use it.

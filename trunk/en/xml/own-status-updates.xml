      <para>I changed the openSUSE mkinitrd to mount the /usr filesystem in the initrd, if /usr is a
        separate partition. I hope this will calm down some heated discussions about systemd, udev,
        etc. It’s not 100% ready yet, some setups like root or /usr on nfs or md might not work as
        expected (*), but the common usecases should be covered. Try updating mkinitrd from
          the <ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Base:/System/openSUSE_Factory/"

          trying very hard to avoid hierarchies, policies and rules. It emphasizes the creative, a
          bit chaotic, side of the FOSS ways for openSUSE to get things done, quickly. Everyone that
          is participating is equal, everyone that is participating is following the same&#160;<ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Guiding_principles">Guiding Principles.</ulink>&#160;The

          ways to contribute to a huge project like ours, so judging if someones contributions

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good

          </title>
          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

        <para>Our first agenda item was for discussion of our experiences with 12.1 MS3. The test of
          a patched plasmoid applet that fixes at least part of Bug #702461 was reported. The new
          version recognized the network devices; however, it was unable to make a wireless

          Gnome desktop. Another member of the TCT reported putting MS3 on a laptop and not having
          any problems. It seems that putting the 3.0-series of kernels on 12.1 has not caused any
          new problems other than the difficulty with 3.0-rc6 that delayed MS3. This matches my
          testing of the mainline kernels. </para>

          The emphasis will be on testing whether bugs reported for 11.4 are still in 12.1. They
          will be fixed if possible, or updated to reflect the fact that they still exist. All
          individuals interested in making 12.1 be an exceptionally good release are welcome. As we
          get closer to the date, more specific instructions will be posted. As usual, we will have
          special on-line tools to help you select a bug for investigation. In preparation for OBD,
          we discussed our plans for publicizing the event, and updated the web page for the event,

      </title>
      <para>It’s been a long time since I was in touch with Enlightenment, back in the young days I
        used it as my first alternative Desktop Environment on Windows, before actually daring to
        switch to Linux. </para>
      <para>Today I hear that version 1.0.0 of the core libraries have been released. Reason enough
        to actually look into this again. So 1 hour, many build failures and successes later, I have
        the entire core-stack built in my obs repository home:dimstar:Enlightenment. The window
        manager Enlightenment itself is not yet released as full release, but the latest snapshot
        can be found in my repo as well. </para>
      <para>But that’s it so far: all core libraries are built. Nothing more. I did not even have
        time to test them yet. </para>
      <para>If you feel adventurous, go, add the repository obs://home:dimstar:Enlightenment to your
        system (published for openSUSE 11.3 and Factory) and start playing with all of the things,
        starting with the window manager, which should generally pull in the rest. What should be
        required (as
        root)<screen>zypper ar obs://home:dimstar:Enlightenment Enlightenment
zypper in enlightenment</screen></para>
      <para>This will add my home repository to your catalog list and install enlightenment
        including dependencies. One logout later, you should see Enlightenment as a new session type
        in your *DM. </para>
      <para>Have a lot of fun and share your experiences… I will test it after I get some
        sleep.</para>

          Tuxies favorite boy group, but a bunch of people dedicated to help the openSUSE Project in
          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,
          so if you have anything do not hesitate to talk to us. We’re here for you.</para>

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder
              how Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

            <para>OBS</para>

                <ulink url="http://build.opensuse.org">web interface</ulink>. After long working
              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good
                <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/projectstatus?project=openSUSE%3AFactory"
                >overview page</ulink> for the Factory project in OBS. It grew a bit more ambitions,

            <para>LinuxTag</para>
            <para>In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in
              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko
              out of pipe cleaners.</para>

            <para>openSUSE 11.3</para>
            <para>In July, openSUSE 11.3 was released. That was lots of work beforehand with quite
              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

            <para>Also in Summer, GUADEC as well as Akademy took place for our desktop Boosters.
              Vincent rocked GUADEC and gave away Geekos and stuff and advertised openSUSE as a good
              platform for the upcoming GNOME3. Will could not go to Akademy this year for a very

            <para>openSUSE conference</para>
            <para>In autumn, the for me most exciting event of the year took place, the second
                <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE Conference</ulink>.
              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>openFATE, Connect and more</para>
            <para>After the conference and the release of 11.3 we started to dig into milestones
              again with <ulink url="http://features.opensuse.org">openFATE</ulink> and <ulink
                url="http://connect.opensuse.org">Connect</ulink>. Since a couple of weeks we have a
              nice looking openFATE that has the features that make it possible for the feature
              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        <para>&quot;Canonical has been very active and released quite an impressive amount of bug
          fixes and features for their Ayatana Project software. I’ve been doing the updates, sent a
          couple of tiny patches upstream (mainly packaging issues) and with the RC1, I am very
          happy with the results accomplished. </para>
        <para>Regarding this project, I’ve seen news, blog posts and lots of feedback from several
          distribution users. I’ve found contents in German, Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese),
          English, Russian and Spanish. For the most I believe everyone is happy this is happening. </para>
        <para>During the next week, I’m going to conduct an open-beta for the GNOME2 indicators from
          which I hope to get some feedback and improve things so that once openSUSE 11.4 is
          release, those users willing to use this software can do it safely, and off course in an
          openSUSE way, a rock solid and featured GNOME experience. </para>
        <para>I’ve created a pattern which will duplicated in the GNOME:Ayatana repository named
          ‘gnome2-indicators’ which will install the 5 base indicators on Ubuntu Natty. About this
          indicators and some previous comments that I’ve seen online, I would like to clarify a

                      packaged this because it offers integration with Notify OSD, the indicator
                      itself is less featured than the traditional gnome extension.</para>

                gwibber. Other applications like pidgin are known to work up to a certain point.
                This indicator grabs any incoming messaging and alerts the user for it. It’s not
                really that bad once you get used to it (takes a couple of hours).</para>

          </orderedlist></para>
        <para>Additionally to this, Notify OSD is also available for openSUSE 11.4, and doesn’t
          require any extra repository. openSUSE 11.4 ships with a version of Notify OSD that allows
          the user to skin/theme it in several ways. This behavior isn’t enabled on Ubuntu and
          relies on a patched refused by upstream by Roman Sokuchev. The development project for
          this package is GNOME:Apps, and my thanks to Vincent Untz and Dominique L. for helping
          with the process. </para>
        <para>During next week, GNOME:Ayatana will be populated and a free open BETA will be start
          to gather feedback amongst our users. </para>
        <para>A side note… Yesterday an update for Sound Menu was issued by Canonical and it deeply
          relies on libnotify &gt;= 0.7.0. openSUSE 11.4 will ship with libnotify 0.6.0 and
          therefore I’m not committing more changes to Sound Menu and will only fix critical issues
          if found for this package. </para>
        <para>After openSUSE 11.4 is released, I’ll start working on implementing this for GNOME3,
          and hopefully now I will have enough time to try to push them to Factory for openSUSE 12
          (or whatever it will be called). </para>
        <para>Contributions are accepted in any area not covered by me, or fixing stuff, and also
          very important, in the KDE field. About Unity… here’s a riddle: “How can you tell if a
          ghost is about to faint?”.&quot;</para>

        </title>
        <para>It’s been a while and there was nothing special to report, KDE SC 4.5 just worked. In
          the meantime KDE SC 4.6 was released and openSUSE offers it in <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/KDE_repositories">KDF as well as KR46 repos</ulink>. Big
          thanks to everybody who is involved in establishing and maintaining those repos – openSUSE
          really profits a lot from the (openSUSE-)KDE community that makes it possible to provide
          such a nice and updated KDE distro. </para>
        <para>Those updating from KDE 4.4 which came with openSUSE 11.3 to 4.6 – please save your
          plasma* files from ~/.kde4/share/config in case plasma crashes after the update.
          Submitting them to Novell’s bugzilla would be much appreciated in order to get those
          crashes fixed for openSUSE 11.4. The same applies to all other issues that come up when
          updating KDE 4.4 to 4.6, e.g. kdepim-related. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE SC 4.6</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>KDE 4.6 has some nice fixes, among them <ulink url="http://bugs.kde.org/163707">bko bug 163707</ulink> which prevented KDE from restoring the resolution set in
          systemsettings on login. This is especially important to openSUSE users since sax2 is gone
          and display settings moved into the desktop environment. Plasma seems to become more
          stable with every release – in fact I did not have any major issues with it since ages and
          bug fixing is pretty fast as well. Dolphin does also not suffer from buggy dbus packages
          anymore and with the latest strigi packages I do not encounter any crashes on close or
          when hovering certain files which did crash dolphin before. Thanks to remur_030 who helped
          the strigi people tracking the latter down for .msi files and thereby found and fixed some
          general issue in strigi which could cause crashes. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Desktop search </emphasis></para>
        <para>The desktop search does still not justify its name though since basics are still
          missing, e.g. context given for search results as all other desktop searches do and kerry
          + beagle already did years ago. <ulink url="http://trueg.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/someone-requested-excerpts-for-query-results/">The feature was shown some months ago</ulink> but is not as such available in KDE 4.6 –
          thus even in KDE 4.6 all the user gets is a replacement of kfind + tagging which needs a
          huge database for that simple task. </para>
        <para>On top of that there are still issues with <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246678">virtuoso-t hogging the CPU</ulink>,
          its database never decreasing in size but only increasing, even if you remove folders from
          the “to be indexed”-list and the systray-tool used to suspend the indexing vanished as
          well decreasing transparency to the user of an app which potentially keeps your hard disk
          and CPU busy. </para>
        <para>Yes, I know there is always a shortage of manpower but IMHO if an app fails to provide
          the very basic features regarding the functionality its name advertises, it will not gain
          any acceptance among users and since every xth user is also a developer it will not
          attract developers either. Thus the extent of this manpower shortage is self-imposed in
          case of nepomuk aka desktop search. </para>
        <para>I think its a bit unfortunate that strigi is always blamed for anything related to the
          desktop search in KDE although it is just the tool that is used by nepomuk and its usage
          is up to nepomuk and not strigi itself, i.e. when to start hammering the hard disk, how to
          handle the results within a database, what results to display when searching, giving the
          user control and information regarding its activities etc. From my experience strigi devs
          are quite responsive regarding bugs and questions – although their websites are all pretty
          much outdated. :) </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 there is still one major mystery bug to solve for openSUSE 32-bit
          NVIDIA users which get <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251719">several apps crashing since they updated to KDE &gt;= 4.5</ulink>. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Power-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Power-management got worse in KDE 4.6, regressions such as not disabling
          powermanagement on desktops and thus suspending the display every 10 minutes, the
          brigtness slider not representing 100% of the brightness supported by the notebook and it
          still messes with the brightness the user has set. All these were reported some weeks ago
          already. Let’s hope that KDE SC 4.6.1 fixes those since that seems to be the version that
          openSUSE 11.4 will ship. </para>
        <para>Further having a presentation-scheme (no suspend, no dimming etc.) is kind of useless
          with KDE 4.6 since it will change to the next scheme if the battery hits any limit. Thus
          you have to permanently watch the status and switch back to the presentation-scheme to be
          save of a suspending notebook while you watch a movie within the presentation or during
          some longer discussion which leads to you not moving the mouse for some minutes. </para>
        <para>Ignoring the scheme the user manually set does indeed make sense but only for the last
          5% of your battery and in order to avoid the notebook just turning off because there was
          no power left. </para>
        <para>openSUSE 11.4 milestones also features a powermanagement bug that makes your hard disk
          suspend every few minutes, confirmed but no fix so far. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Package-management</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>For openSUSE 11.4 we are currently <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_packagekit">testing kpackagekit/apper</ulink> as a replacement for the unmaintained kupdateapplet.
          Kpackagekit works ok but it seems that its zypper backend could need some improvements.
          And the next version of kpackagekit which will be called apper features monochrome systray
          icons which is fine, but the “security patch available” signal is just a tiny red dot
          which is hardly visible, especially if your eye-sight is not the best or you are suffering
          red-green colour blindness. So most issues with kpackagekit are not actually kpackagekit’s
          fault but either backend-related or touching artists’ taste. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Phonon-backends</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Another application <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:KDE_11.4_phonon-backend">to test is the phonon-backend</ulink> to be used in openSUSE 11.4 by default. Should we stay with xine
          whose backend is apparently unmaintained but has served most users well, switch to the
          vlc-backend or maybe use the gstreamer-backend? </para>
        <para>Trying to play some file with amarok and the gstreamer-backend brings up some dialogue
          (/usr/lib/gst-install-plugins-helper) that asks whether it should search for some package,
          I guess codecs. If one clicks on “search” kpackagekit opens up and claims instantly that
          “Getting what provides” finished but does not do anything. This is on 11.3 plus KDE 4.6
          from KDF, so let’s hope it works better on 11.4. </para>
        <para>The vlc-backend consumes the double amount of CPU for playing the same mp3 via amarok.
          8% instead of 4% might not be that much in absolute terms but a 100% waste nonetheless and
          especially on mobile devices everything that wastes battery should be avoided. Further
          there seem to be issues playing video via vlc, some apps like dragonplayer. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">KDE-PIM </emphasis></para>
        <para>And finally there is of course the always present issue of KDE-PIM. openSUSE 11.4 will
          ship kdepim 4.4.10 which needs testing. There is especially <ulink url="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185544">one annoying bug which makes kontact crash</ulink> when logging in if the last view before logging out was kmail. So let’s
          hope this can be fixed before 11.4 gets released.</para>
        <para>I was really looking forward to KDE-PIM 4.6 since IMAP-support seems a lot better with
          akonadi, at least for my use-cases which include suspending/resuming. The latter makes
          KDE-PIM 4.4′s imap slave fail and not recover which works fine with KDE-PIM 4.6. You can
          get regularly updated packages for the latter off openSUSE’s UNSTABLE KDE repo. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Help testing </emphasis></para>
        <para>Please help testing KDE SC 4.6 from the openSUSE repos in order to make it shine in
          openSUSE 11.4. Feedback can go to the related wiki pages or straight to
          opensuse-kde@.</para>

        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for

          Tuxies favorite boy group, but a bunch of people dedicated to help the openSUSE Project in
          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,
          so if you have anything do not hesitate to talk to us. We’re here for you.</para>

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Dev meeting</para>
            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder
              how Will managed to get around with definitely no sleep for days.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

            <para>OBS</para>

                <ulink url="http://build.opensuse.org">web interface</ulink>. After long working
              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good
                <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/projectstatus?project=openSUSE%3AFactory"
                >overview page</ulink> for the Factory project in OBS. It grew a bit more ambitions,

            <para>In June, there was LinuxTag in Berlin where most of us participated with talks in
              the free program or workshops on our booth. We educated a lot of people how to
              contribute to openSUSE in various ways. From submitting code fixes through the Build
              Service to creating great Geeko graphics with Inkscape to how to twist their own Geeko

            <para>In July, openSUSE 11.3 was released. That was lots of work beforehand with quite
              some boosters involvement, as Mr. Distro Coolo is part of the team. However not only
              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the
              world release parties were organized, some Boosters took over the one here in
              Nürnberg. <ulink

              7pm, because many community members showed up. Cool, I love that kind of stress to

              Vincent rocked GUADEC and gave away Geekos and stuff and advertised openSUSE as a good

                <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE Conference</ulink>.
              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a
                <quote>This is what we did</quote> in the last year to a <quote>this is what we
                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as
                <quote>Project Brezn</quote> and openSUSE Invis which slowly evolves.</para>

            <para>openFATE, Connect and more</para>
            <para>After the conference and the release of 11.3 we started to dig into milestones
              again with <ulink url="http://features.opensuse.org">openFATE</ulink> and <ulink
                url="http://connect.opensuse.org">Connect</ulink>. Since a couple of weeks we have a
              nice looking openFATE that has the features that make it possible for the feature
              screening team to work on one of our most important tasks in our project: Looking into
              the future of the distribution with feature evaluation. We also implemented the future
              of the user/group handling for all the openSUSE services with a social twist: Connect.
              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the
              user data.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Busy 2010</emphasis></para>
        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </title>
        <para>This text is based on a personal interpretation of several events, and as such it
          reflects one of several potential interpretations, MINE!</para>
        <para>On the last <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_team">GNOME Team</ulink><ulink url="http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-gnome/2011/opensuse-gnome.2011-06-16-15.32.html">meeting</ulink> there was a small topic to check if it would be interesting to have a
          GNOME2 spin for the upcoming 12.1 release of <ulink url="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</ulink>. It was decided not to provide a GNOME2 spin and somehow this suggests
          that GNOME2 is dead for openSUSE (unless someone takes the job in).</para>
        <para>One of the interesting things that poped during this meeting was the fact that <ulink url="http://www.gnome3.org">GNOME3</ulink> has a ‘fallback mode’, or at least that’s how
          it became to be knownýamongýGNOME users, press and competitors. It’s not really hard to
          understand that ‘fallback’ became a connotative form that throws in a lot of negative
          energy, much in the way that it seems to be an unwanted ‘feature’.</para>
        <para>I believe that <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Vuntz">Vincent Untz</ulink>
          proposed a very interesting plan regarding this “GNOME3 vs GNOME2″ possibilities: provide
          an alternative Desktop option where the feature known as ‘fallback mode’ can be presented
          as an attractive option to the standard GNOME Shell for users who seek ‘classic’ looks.
          It’s somehow unclear to me how we will achieve this, but I’m sure that a few ideas might
          have been already on the forge for testing.</para>
        <para>The <ulink url="http://www.fedoraproject.org">Fedora Project</ulink> has taken a
          different approach and it seems that <ulink url="http://ostatic.com/blog/how-would-you-like-gnome-2-32-on-fedora-15">GNOME2 is making it’s way into Fedora 15</ulink>, the most controversial release of the Fedora
          Project, nevertheless one of their greatest, maybe only surpassed by Fedora 13. This
          initiative is called ‘BlueBubble’ and lead by Fedora Ambassador and Packager <ulink url="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Nushio">Juan Moreno</ulink>, to whom I wish all
          the success with his work, as I’m sure that many Fedora users will be thrilled with such
          option available.</para>
        <para>Back into the openSUSE world I also recognize a huge amount of value, and though it
          might become a complicate task to strike down the current idea people have about the
          ‘fallback mode’ (clearly a huge failure from whoever decided to call it ‘fallback mode’)
          and try to make it a more useful feature towards the classic GNOME2 Desktop, thus
          promoting among our users that upgrading to GNOME3 is the way! With openSUSE there won’t
          be a 10th year for GNOME2 life cycle! The future lies only with GNOME3 which has shown
          great potential and stability on it’s initial release, specially if we compare it to the
          initial release of it’s main competitors, <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">KDE4</ulink> and
            <ulink url="http://launchpad.net/unity">Unity</ulink>.</para>
        <para>openSUSE and GNOME3 lead the way now!</para>

        </title>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Plasma Active Updates</emphasis></para>
        <para>During the past weeks, we’ve been kind of silent around Plasma Active. This doesn’t
          mean we’ve just been sitting on our lazy bums, but that we’ve poured a lot of work into
          various aspects of the Plasma Active user experience. Let me details these changes to give
          you some idea of where we are. But first off, …</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">What is Plasma Active?</emphasis></para>
        <para>Plasma Active is a KDE project building a touch-friendly user experience for the
          device spectrum. You can compare it to the KDE Software Compilation, Plasma Active
          provides a workspace and applications. The first focused target devices are tablets, such
          as the ExoPC, also known as WeTab. Plasma Active builds on top of KDE frameworks such as
          the Plasma libraries and the Nepomuk Semantic Desktop, offering a touch-friendly interface
          taylored to use-cases of the specific device. Components of Plasma Active are re-usable
          across different devices, bringing many well-known apps to new devices. The user interface
          used on a specific device can differ across devices, making sure it fits the devices
          characteristics and use-cases.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">How is Plasma Active developed?</emphasis></para>
        <para>Plasma Active is fully community-developed and builds on existing KDE frameworks.
          Re-using technologies such as Plasma, we already have quite some usefl apps to run on
          Plasma Active, more apps are relatively easy to write or to port to Plasma Active. (I’ll
          explain more about this in a later blog.) One very nice thing is that Plasma Active by
          design is “ultimately hackable”, it uses components that many people know already, many
          aspects of the system can even be directly changed on the device by opening it’s QML files
          with the description of the user interfaces.</para>
        <para>Plasma Active’s development happens in KDE’s Git infrastructure, communication can be
          followed on the active@kde.org mailinglist, our IRC channel (#active on irc.freenode.net)
          is welcoming and open for everyone. This doesn’t mean that there’s no commercial
          investment in Plasma Active, or that it’s impossible to participate in Plasma Active as a
          commercially interested partner, it’s just that the foundation is in the hands of a Free
          software project — KDE — leveling the playing field for everybody else. Two good examples
          for commercial partners in Plasma Active are basysKom and open-slx. <ulink url="http://www.basyskom.com">BasysKom</ulink> contributes design and development effort
          into the Contour shell, which forms the basic workspace for Plasma Active. <ulink url="http://www.open-slx.com">open-slx</ulink> (my employer :)) invests into development
          of Plasma Active core components, system integration, packaging, testing and deployment.
          As such, we continously work on turning Plasma Active from Git Repo into something
          end-user ready — which is also our mission, we want to bring Plasma Active to the masses.
          For this, we’re releasing regularly updated <ulink url="http://open-slx.com/?Downloads">Live Images of Balsam Professional</ulink> running Plasma Active, and we’re working
          hard on making these images also installable. You can test those images in a virtual
          machine (you’ll want one that supports composited graphics, such as Virtual Box), or
          directly on the device. The Balsam Professional Live Image boots out of the box on the
          ExoPC / WeTab, and we’re working on support for more diverse hardware.</para>
        <para>To keep track of our different focus points, we’ve created a map of the different
          “tracks” we follow with our development.</para>
        <para><inlinegraphic fileref="http://vizzzion.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/activeroutes.png"/></para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Where is Plasma Active Today?</emphasis></para>
        <para>System-wise, the current status is that we have a <ulink url="http://open-slx.com/?Downloads">bootable live image (Balsam Professional)</ulink>
          with a touch-friendly shell, a bunch of apps that can be used. Boot performance is a bit
          on the slow side right now (but improving, there are some changes to the boot process
          planned), runtime performance is pretty good already, as you can see in the videos that
          we’ve posted already. At open-slx we are working on refining the image in terms of
          preconfiguration, performance and so on. We’re also quite close to making the image
          installable, so you can easily install it once (as dualboot on your device, if you wish)
          and then keep tracking Plasma Active development just by updating your packages
          regularly.</para>
        <para>During the Meego conference in San Francisco, basysKom demoed parts of Plasma Active
          and the Contour shell. A video has been recorded which gives a good idea of which
          direction we’re going: <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3abBR1qLn0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3abBR1qLn0</ulink></para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Resource visualization</emphasis>: As we’re using Nepomuk as
              the underlying data structure, we’ve implemented data-driven widgets that represent
              “Things” in the Nepomuk store. These can be local files, online resources, but also
              abstract things like tags, for example. These “Resource delegates” as we call them
              form basic building blocks of your assets in Plasma Active. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Web-browser and web-integration</emphasis>: As “The Web” is
              one of the most important use-cases for Plasma Active, we’re spending quite some time
              now on making this work really well. After shopping around, we decided that our best
              bet on the web-browser would be a touch-friendly version of Rekonq, using QML. We’ve
              already made some progress towards that direction, but we’re not there yet. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Share-Like-Connect</emphasis>: Share-Like-Connect will bring
              ubiquitous (just *had* to use this word once ;)) social networking and sharing to
              Plasma Active. I’ll not go into details here since this topic is way too awesome, so
              we’ll dedicate a separate post to it. </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>From my personal point of view as a user, I must say that Plasma Active is becoming a
          rock star. It’s already quite usable for surfing the web, reading news or email. It is not
          stable software yet, more comparable to an Alpha state (there are quite some bugs left to
          be squished, and it’s not feature complete). Our progress is very noticeable, however,
          which is promising for our first targeted released end of September.</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good

        </title>
        <para>MonoDevelop 2.6 beta 1 was released yesterday. Like every major release, it has many
          new features. Here is a summary of what have we done.</para>
        <para>The first new big feature is <emphasis role="bold">support for GIT</emphasis>. This
          was long time due, especially since Mono and MonoDevelop itself moved to GIT. I already
            <ulink url="http://foodformonkeys.blogspot.com/2010/10/ngit.html">blogged about it</ulink> a few months ago, but basically we are using NGit, a C# port of JGit, as the
          core for the GIT add-in. It hasn&apos;t been easy to make this port fully operational, but we
          now have a GIT core that can be easily updated and which is fully portable.(...)</para>

          </title>
          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

          <para>Since I still have a ntfs partition to easily share files between Windows and Linux, I had problems mounting the ntfs partition through Dolphin. First I had to add &quot;ntfs&quot; to /etc/filesystems to make it work with Dolphin.</para>
          <para>However, for me, it is no problem to add this line. But I have a few colleagues with now run openSUSE as well, who have no desire to manually change config files. However, they had to, to get their ntfs partition, in their case an external hard drive, running.
I&apos;d really prefer if this line could be added to the /etc/filesystems file.</para>

          <para>That means, if you just click on &quot;next&quot; during installation, you will auto log in with your user, when you start your system. This happens without any password-check.</para>
          <para>This might be good for people who just want to work with their PC and don&apos;t think about the system. But it&apos;s a big security risk. Think of you got personal files on your harddrive, and your user is logged-in automaticly. Now, other people can easy get access to your /home dir. They just need to start your PC.</para>

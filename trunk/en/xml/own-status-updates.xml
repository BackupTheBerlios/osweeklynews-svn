        >Rajko Matovic: Bug days in openSUSE</ulink></title>
      <para>We had quite successful openSUSE Bug Day organized by A. Naumov on Saturday, November
        27, and once rolling we continued through Sunday. The goal was to clear old bugs that
        refused to die for quite some time. You can see what is done in the wiki article. November
        28th, evening by US Central Time: <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>openSUSE 10.2: Start 40 bugs now we have 14 bugs left.</para>

        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>We started with 728 bugs and now we have 447, which is 281 bug lesser. I hope that A.
        Naumov will repeat call for the next Bug Day right next weekend. (EDITMARK)</para>

        <para>Having an awesome time here at the conference - esp last night
        with the Movie Night, the Movies were cool. As was the beer during and
        afterwards…</para>

        <para>During the day I followed talk by Lubos Lunak about the Build
        Service as I wanted to learn more about it. As I made notes I decided
        to share them :D</para>

        <para>In the introduction Lubos shared that apparently you have to
        package each application by hand - however, automatic downloading of
        random tarballs from the internet and turning them into packages for
        all linux distributions on distrowatch.org is planned for OBS 3.0!

        <para>With established ARM support in OBS the as well as emulated MIPS
        and PowerPC is getting more mature, the last big embedded architecture
        not working in OBS with QEMU user mode was SH4. QEMU developers
        community had done a lot of work in improving QEMU user mode during
        the last months, so I can proudly present with currently only a few
        patches to QEMU git master OBS builds working with the SH4 port of
        Debian Sid. The new QEMU 0.13 released recently is a big milestone for
        this. (…)</para>

        <para>Last Friday, I headed to Lyon for the JDLL 2010. It's an event
        that feels always a bit special for me since the JDLL was the first
        event I attended a long while ago. Even though it's not the biggest
        event in France, for some reason, all the usual suspects from the
        french-speaking free software community is coming. So a good place to
        be to catch up with various people (Alexandre, Didier, FrédéricP,
        Michael from the GNOME-FR conspiracycommunity, as well as our friends
        from Mageia, and more). (…)</para>

        <para>Yesterday evening, I added the first animation to the KWin

        change over a configurable time span when the dashboard appears. The

        obstrusive (hopefully).</para>

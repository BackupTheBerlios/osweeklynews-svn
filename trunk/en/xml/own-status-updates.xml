      <para>A lot of things are happening in our Factory distribution that will be released in
        November 2011 as openSUSE 12.1 and I’d like to point out a few things from the last few weeks
        that users and developers of factory shouldn’t miss.</para>

      <para>The GNU Compiler Collection has been updated to version 4.6, the list of <ulink
        url="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html">changes</ulink> includes the following new

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>“New -Wunused-but-set-variable and -Wunused-but-set-parameter warnings were added for
            C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++. These warnings diagnose variables respective
            parameters which are only set in the code and never otherwise used. Usually such variables
            are useless and often even the value assigned to them is computed needlessly, sometimes
            expensively. The -Wunused-but-set-variable warning is enabled by default by -Wall flag and
            -Wunused-but-set-parameter by -Wall -Wextra flags.”</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Some packages have been failing by the new GCC due to new warnings and new optimizations
        and most have been fixed already but please double check that your packages are building and
        running fine.</para>

        >announced</ulink><ulink url="http://rpm.org/wiki/Releases/4.9.0">RPM 4.9</ulink> for
        Factory. He explains the main packager visible changes as:<blockquote>
          <para>Besides some bug fixes and an update to a newer BerkeleyDB library rpm-4.9.0 contains
            plugin architecture for dependency generation. In older rpms, the internal dependency
            generator was pretty much hardcoded in C, so we always used the old external one to
            generate dependencies. With rpm-4.9.0, the internal generator has become flexible enough
            so that we can use it.</para>
          <para>This means for you, that rpm will no longer use the %__find_provides and
            %__find_requires macros. Some packages redefined those macros to be able to filter the
            generated dependencies.</para>
          <para>This will no longer work in rpm-4.9.0. Instead, support for dependency filtering was
            added to rpm…</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Packaging Changes</emphasis></para>
      <para>Besides new software, also new ways of handling it get introduced. The following catched
        my eyes:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Changing the process of Factory submissions with the Open Build
        Service</emphasis></para>
      <para>Now with every submission to Factory scripts are run automatically that do two different
        reviews before the package goes to human check-in review:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The “legal-auto” review checks the updated package for changes in licenses.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The “factory-auto” review checks that the updated package builds actually in the devel
            project – and if not, rejects it.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The “legal-auto” review has quite a long backlog at the moment and Jýrgen is working on
        moving some of the checks to rpmlint or osc checks – so that the packager notices and fixes
        them before submission to Factory.</para>
      <para>Also, you can now submit packages to Factory even if you are not the maintainer of the
        package but in this case the maintainer (packager) gets a review request to review that the
        package really can go to factory and thus a plea to packagers to handle their review
        requests.</para>

          >SUSE Studio API</ulink> to support <ulink url="http://susegallery.com/">SUSE
          Gallery</ulink>, I developed a desktop client at the same time as a testbed. It's been a
        bit neglected over the last 6 months, as my <ulink
          url="http://www.entomologist-project.org/">primary after-work project</ulink> takes up a
        lot of my time, but it's usable nonetheless. In an effort to motivate me to work on it
        again, and to find other contributors, I'm happy to announce the <ulink

      <para>With the Gallery client, you can browse, search, view details, download, write to a CD
        or USB key, or execute the image directly in a virtual machine. There's rudimentary support
        for connecting to Testdrive, but the built-in VNC client isn't very reliable , so don't be
        surprised if it doesn't work. Packages have been built for openSUSE and Fedora, but it
        should compile on any platform that Qt and LibVNCViewer support (including Windows and Mac).
        And of course, contributions and bug reports are most welcome!</para>

          any way we can. The team consists of 13 people (BTW: widely known as the thirsty thirteen)
          with skills ranging from low level C hackery over Ruby on Rails mastering to Graphical
          Design or Project Management. Our team picks milestones and works on them in a agile
          fashion while always following our mantra: Grow community by enabling community. You can
          meet us at the usual places like IRC, the mailinglists or events were we show up and
          spread the word about openSUSE. We’re there to make contributors life easier and more fun,

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg
              office. They worked on the highly rated plasma workspace for KDE 4.5. I still wonder

            <para>Bento and wiki work</para>
            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              hours we finally came out with a great web interface for OBS which was a big bum for
              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

              he is contributing to the distribution, we all have our shares in it. 11.3 was a good
              one, it got good press and showed that we as a community are doing great. All over the

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a

                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as

        <para>So all in all the boosters had a very busy and prosperous year 2010. All of us carried
          their individual share of work in the various areas of the openSUSE project we participate
          in, be it in the openSUSE KDE and GNOME Teams, the openSUSE Distribution, the openSUSE
          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>Sometime ago Gabriel asked me if I could give him help with the Banshee repositories
          for openSUSE; This repositories have many users hanging around and some packages are
          enabled on other projects, which makes them somehow sensible to deep changes.</para>
        <para>Today I’ve pushed to openSUSE:Factory Banshee 2.0.1 (latest stable release) and a few
          packages which live in the Banshee repository. I’ve also submitted a deletion request to
          ipod-sharp which is no longer maintained and was replaced in the past for libgpod.</para>
        <para>I’ve fixed the pending issues I’ve seen on the Banshee repository and Banshee 2.0.1
          and disabled SLE 11 builds (not requiring all the dependencies). The repository serves now
          the following platforms (banshee and banshee-community-extensions):<itemizedlist>

          such evil task.</para>
        <para>In the future, on the next stable release (2.2.0), I’ll move the changes from
          Banshee:Unstable to Banshee and hopefully change the development repository to Banshee (as
          if Factory has the latest stable release it makes no sense in having Banshee’s development
          repository in Banshee:Unstable) and synch all at once.</para>
        <para>Users subscribed to Banshee:Unstable repository might see some turbulence during the

          installing Banshee with the changes described above.</para>

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </title>
        <para>We’ve been busy bees in the growing Plasma Active team, so it’s time to post some
          progress updates. In case you forgot, Plasma Active is a KDE project to create a desirable
          user experience for the device spectrum, with its first focus to create a system suitable
          for tablet computers. In my <ulink url="http://vizzzion.org/blog/2011/04/plasma-active-a-desirable-user-experience-encompassing-the-device-spectrum/">first post</ulink> about Plasma Active, you can see the basic shell running on a 10
          inch Viewsonic Viewtab. In this post, I’m using a Wetab to demo the current state of
          Plasma Active. The Wetab is one of our test devices. It’s a nice target device since it’s
          Intel Atom-based, which makes building Plasma Active a bit easier, and thus shortens our
          development-testing-deployment cycles considerable. The Wetab can currently be gotten from
          German Ebay for 219⃽ + shipping, so it’s also quite affordable. </para>
        <para> Back to the software, though. Our focus in the past weeks has been two-fold, we’ve
          done a lot of “small fixes” which greatly improve the user experience. The other class of
          changes is less visible at this point, but still fun and exciting. (...)</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>

          now have a GIT core that can be easily updated and which is fully portable.(...)</para>

          </title>
          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

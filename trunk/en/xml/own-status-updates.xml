      </title>
      <para>I changed the openSUSE mkinitrd to mount the /usr filesystem in the initrd, if /usr is a
        separate partition. I hope this will calm down some heated discussions about systemd, udev,
        etc. It’s not 100% ready yet, some setups like root or /usr on nfs or md might not work as
        expected (*), but the common usecases should be covered. Try updating mkinitrd from
          the&#160;<ulink url="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Base:/System/openSUSE_Factory/">Base:System project</ulink>&#160;and let me know if it works for you. Before testing it, you
        should do a backup of your initrd:</para>
      <para>
        <programlisting># cp /boot/initrd-`uname -r`{,.orig}</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>and create a section in /boot/grub/menu.lst pointing to the /boot/initrd-*.orig
        file.</para>

          <para>I repeat what I said before so everyone is on the same page:</para>
          <para>Version numbers are per se no information and we want to offer users an easy,
            standarized way to find out what changed. But it’s not the packager’s job to collect
            upstream NEWS. So if the upstream project does not offer a summary, then say so in the
            .changes file, so also the user knows. If the upstream&#160; project does not provide a
            summary but a detailed web page, then a link is fine too.</para>

        quite a lot libraries and binaries from /usr to the rootpartition to allow having /usr as

        changes in many places and testing that everything worked as well. With mounting from the

        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good

        <para>MonoDevelop 2.6 beta 1 was released yesterday. Like every major release, it has many
          new features. Here is a summary of what have we done.</para>
        <para>The first new big feature is <emphasis role="bold">support for GIT</emphasis>. This
          was long time due, especially since Mono and MonoDevelop itself moved to GIT. I already
            <ulink url="http://foodformonkeys.blogspot.com/2010/10/ngit.html">blogged about it</ulink> a few months ago, but basically we are using NGit, a C# port of JGit, as the
          core for the GIT add-in. It hasn&apos;t been easy to make this port fully operational, but we
          now have a GIT core that can be easily updated and which is fully portable.(...)</para>

          </title>
          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been
            rejected by the upstream project in favor of using GRUB 2. There has been resisitence in
            the distribution community to switching boot loaders, but this stalemate isn&apos;t
            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

              release number was changed to reflect the basesystem release number correctly. This
              will probably continue to happen as this change is propagated throughout the openSUSE
              build system to fix up these errors by the various developers. You can safely ignore
              them when they happen.</para>

      <para>Hello Mates. The last year was a great year. We had seen many funny things. The Relaunch
        of the openSUSE BuildService now provides many Features for packager. Then the
        kde-obs-generator makes the life easier for cross packaging. The openSUSE Conference was
        another interesting Highlight, and last but not least the sell of Novell. </para>
      <para>The openSUSE Weekly News Team searches the whole week for new things. Now we searching one
        or two new Contributors who are collecting news with us. In the past we have given one part
        of the news to one person, and that person was responsible for this part of the Weekly News.
        As Example you provide the Section &quot;Tips and Tricks&quot; so you can add and remove that Section
        what do you think is the best.</para>
      <para>ATM we can give the following Sections to a good Hand:</para>

      <para>Congratulations to the Drupal community for getting <ulink url="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">version 7.0</ulink>
        <ulink url="http://drupal.org/drupal-7-released">released</ulink>! This is a major mile
        stone and an excellent reason to <ulink url="http://www.drupal7releaseparty.org/">celebrate</ulink>! If you want to give Drupal 7 a try without having to install anything,
        I&apos;ve now updated my Drupal 7 appliances on <ulink url="http://susestudio.com/">SuSE Studio</ulink> to the latest release. The appliance is based on <ulink url="http://software.opensuse.org/113/en">openSUSE Linux 11.3</ulink> and is available in
        two variants:<itemizedlist>

      <para>The database backend is phpMyAdmin has been added to support web-based administration of
        the MySQL server. You can access it via http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/. I also added <ulink url="http://drush.ws/">drush</ulink>, the Drupal command line shell and scripting
        interface and some additional packages (yast2-http-server, bind-utils, php5-ctype, patch). I
        also bumped up the appliance&apos;s version number to 7.0.0, to match the version number of
        Drupal included. </para>
      <para>The appliance is available in various formats:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A live raw disk image, ready to be written to an USB stick or flash drive</para>
          </listitem>

      <para>So congratulations to the Drupal developer community for reaching this goal and thanks
        to SuSE/Novell/Attachmate for providing the infrastructure for creating such appliances. I
        also would like to especially thank <ulink url="http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/rbos/">Richard Bos</ulink> for the testing and many suggestions for improvement of these
        appliances!</para>

        <para>I’ve received some emails and some positive feedback about one wallpaper I used for a

          where that very same wallpaper could be found. I’m happy people liked my choice. </para>

        <para>It is clear to me at this stage that Artwork has good demand and it’s a ‘value +’

            <listitem>
              <para>GNOME:Ayatana will have a small Artwork Package by the Community, I’m currently
                contacting Kmurat to check if he can change the licence on this artwork piece (with
                over 20.000 downloads on gnome-art) so I can use it for distribution. Currently it’s
                licensed as CC BY-NC-ND, in which the NC can be probably a problem. Let’s wait a
                couple of days and see… Either way for those who asked for the source of this

          I’ve contacted regarding this was Javier Llorente, a openSUSE Artwork Team and KDE
          contributor, which donated and pointed some artwork. I’ve also sent a small email to
            <ulink url="http://tatica.org">María ‘Tatica’ Leandro</ulink>, a contributor of Fedora
          Design Team from South America asking if she had something that she could share with us
          for this community package (I did loved some of her submissions into Fedora Art).
          Additionally, I’m also going to nag <ulink url="http://karl-tux-stadt.de">Sirko Kemter
            (gnokii)</ulink> for a contribution… </para>
        <para>Once this is assembled (already have 5 wallpapers) I’m going to package it, run a
          sanity check and prepare it for distribution… </para>

            <para>FOSDEM</para>
            <para>Lets start with a very important event, FOSDEM in Brussels in February. We
              traveled there by coach the first time. That was remarkable because there were some
              push back against before (long journey) but we did it because it is cheaper, which
              means more people can go. The result was that we all were quite pleased by the coach
              trip as it was comfortable and fun, and finally not so much longer than the flight.
              And yes, consider how much carbon dioxide was saved? Since that trip I am constantly
              nagging for budget for an openSUSE Coach…</para>
            <para>I held a talk about Hermes at FOSDEM which was, well, not a great success, that
              thing seems hard to market. That happens, others were more succesfull, like
              Christopher with his talk about image building with Kiwi. Michal had a meeting with
              MySQL packagers from all over the world at FOSDEM, which was probably the first real
              initiative to collaborate on cross distro topics. I also bought a GNOME T-Shirt, met
              tons of old friends, had cherry beer and got a cold as usual on FOSDEM.</para>

            <para>Also in February, we hosted a dev meeting of 25 KDE hackers here in the Nuremberg

            <para>At home, at the beginning of the year we worked on projects called
                <quote>Integrate all Infrastructure under one Umbrella</quote> which resulted in the
              Bento web theme nowadays at all openSUSE sites use. It provides short ways from one
              site to another by thought through and pretty menus. Robert did a real great job with
              that and we got a lot of external recognition for it. At the same time the Wiki
              project started which was a huge project the Wiki community was pulling together with
              Henne and Tom. The decision was to create a new Wiki from scratch, implement reviewing
              features and transfer all relevant content into the new one while making sure to not
              transfer stuff nobody needs and maintains any more. That was a big thing and caused a
              lot of discussion. Today we can look back and say that we now have a well structured
              Wiki with valuable content. Fortune favors the bold :-)</para>

              the whole project, as it makes working in OBS much more fun. I remember that whole
              thing being started as a sprint called “Factory status”, aiming to provide a good

              We were heavily involved in organizing, program committee work, giving talks and
              presentations and all what is involved with that kind of large event. It was a huge
              success, as a very active and passionate community showed up. Discussions went from a

                could do</quote> which is so great to see as that is resulting in innovation for the
              whole project. As a result some very concrete sub projects were created such as

              Our own instance of a social network that makes it possible to connect the people that
              make this project what it is and at the same time makes it possible to centralize the

          tools or the openSUSE Board. We attended a lot of events and organized a couple of our own
          with great success. And we worked together on the most pressing milestones we saw for
          contributor growth in a fun and clever way. All in all we helped a lot of contributors to
          stand up, take responsibility and do get their hands dirty for the openSUSE Project. That
          makes us proud and we will do this smarter, faster, better and stronger in 2011.

        </title>
        <para>MySQL 5.5 is GA for more then a month already. If you are reading some news, you
          probably already heard, that it is great, million times faster, has trillion new features
          that you desperately need and much more. Of course, I’m exaggerating a little bit. But
          anyway, MySQL 5.5 is new version everybody talks about. So now when do you get it? It is
          already lying around for some time in server:database:UNSTABLE repository. It was there
          since beta, but took me some time to get final version ready. Just add it to your
          repositories for example by:</para>
        <screen>zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database:/UNSTABLE/openSUSE_11.3 server-database-unstable&gt;</screen>
        <para>and then install it by</para>
        <screen>zypper in mysql-community-server_55</screen>
        <para>As it conflicts with whatever MySQL variant you currently have, it will ask you to
          confirm uninstallation of your currently installed MySQL. Then it will replace it and you
          can start trying it.</para>
        <para>And to answer question when it will be in official openSUSE. For 11.4 is too late. I
          know it was made GA last year already, but as many things depends on MySQL, I don’t want
          to accidentally break something. So you can expect it in next openSUSE (11.5 or 12.0, not
          sure what the name would be). And maybe in Tumbleweed a little bit sooner, after some
          testing, but currently don’t know when. And of course, it is build not only for openSUSE
          11.3, so here comes full list of repositories it is built for:</para>

        <para>This has been one of the guidelines in my life for quite some time… It started as a
          curiosity a long time ago with Notify OSD and evolved to full project in openSUSE. It is
          important to acknowledge at this point the motivation provided by the openSUSE GNOME Team
          from which I’ve been getting plenty of guidance and help, namely from Vincent Untz (vuntz)
          and Dominique ﻿Leuenberger (Dimstar). Thanks to them, we have now a GNOME:Ayatana Project
          on OBS (openSUSE Build Service), currently being populated with the support libraries for
          Ayatana’s Unity and Indicators.</para>
        <para>Susan Linton has made a small article for Linux Journal about this project in the
          past. Though some people pointed to me that it was advertising and excelling Ubuntu… I
          would like to leave a statement… We’re not taking a hike on Ubuntu visibility, and it
          isn’t bad at all, on the contrary… In fact it will help Ubuntu, us and many others…
          specially if some Ubuntu patches are accepted faster by upstream. I hope other RPM
          distributions will follow the way we, openSUSE, proudly seem to pioneering! From my
          personal point of view… a distribution <quote>distributes</quote>… and despite this
          software isn’t attractive for some openSUSE users, I’m happy it is available (totally or
          partially) for all those who want to test it… Wait… you don’t even need to install Ubuntu
          or changing the platform you run!</para>
        <para>Due to several reasons, being the most important of them versioning, this repository
          will start on the next release of openSUSE in March 16th (World day of Conscience,
          interesting point). This is also interesting as if YOU are willing to improve a package or
          submit a package you can now do it to this repository.</para>

          released and the focus shifts to the newer 4.7 release. </para>
        <para>I will keep you posted on the developments around this repository, but this would be
          the moment to switch over to KDE:Distro:Factory if you want to get the RC1, RC2 and KDE

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good
          balance between a few, most probably contradictory things:<itemizedlist>

          openSUSE or, more generally, use the openSUSE trademarks in one way or another. </para>

          <para>Some Lenovo laptops use the UPEK driver for fingerprint. Using the latest version of
            fingerprint-gui (which also ships the UPEK drivers) gives me a perfect functionality of
            my device. However, Yast does still not recognize my device. Could it be easily
            implemented?</para>

        <para>The next Testing Core Team IRC meeting will be held 2011-01-31 at 18:00 UTC and will
          discuss 11.4 M6.</para>
        <para>Attendance at the December 27 meeting was optional. As many of the team were on
          holiday, only two were present. Neither of us had any particular problems with 11.4 M5,
          thus we took some time to get to know each other. As we did not have a real meeting, the
          IRC log will not be posted.</para>
        <para>The openSUSE forums have not had many complaints about M5, thus it appears to be
          shaping up quite well. In addition, the 2.6.37 kernel, which is used in 11.4, will have
          its release in roughly 1-2 weeks, thus there will be approximately 3 months of kernel
          testing before 11.4 is released. That is good timing.</para>
        <para>Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous new year.</para>

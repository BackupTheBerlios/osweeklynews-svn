        <para>This time around the Boosters took on a milestone for the benefit of the Membership
          Officials team. To explain who they are and what they do we have to look a bit further
          into the openSUSE Project. Because of its history and relatively young age the project is
          trying very hard to avoid hierarchies, policies and rules. It emphasizes the creative, a
          bit chaotic, side of the FOSS ways for openSUSE to get things done, quickly. Everyone that
          is participating is equal, everyone that is participating is following the same <ulink

          ways to contribute to a huge project like ours, so judging if someones contributions

          <ulink url="http://www.rosenauer.org/blog/2011/04/17/evergreen-status-after-some-months/">Wolfgang Rosenauer: Evergreen status after some months</ulink>
        </title>
        <para>I’ve just noticed that I haven’t written about <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">Evergreen</ulink> here since the
          beginning. I actually did post at least one status update on our list but I think it would
          be good to give some information to a wider audience (hoping that this blog is read by
          more people).</para>
        <para>In general we are in good shape. Up to now we have released around 55 source updates.
          You can find the list <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen_11.1">here</ulink>. So looking back that means that we were able to update almost everything
          including desktop applications which was not clear in the beginning how that would work
          out. Also the Packman team decided to support Evergreen by keeping the Essentials
          repository available. Unfortunately it is not quite usable at the moment since it contains
          RPM packages signed with keys not supported by the RPM version in 11.1 which means zypper
          refuses to install those.</para>
        <para>Another milestone is that it seems we will also support 11.2 when it runs out of
          Novell’s maintenance on May 12th, 2011. Another community member agreed to lead the
          effort. More details on that to come soon.</para>
        <para>But not everything is working perfectly fine though. Besides some rare cases where
          community members submitted packages to Evergreen/11.1 all the backporting/packaging work
          up to now was done by myself. At some points in time I was quite on the limit of my time
          for the project and there is no redundancy if something bad happens to me. We really need
          more people contributing to Evergreen. That said it would be really nice if maintainers
          (especially community maintainers) would prepare updates for 11.1 as well. Obviously there
          is no obligation in doing so but I somehow think that in some cases they are just missing
          the fact that Evergreen exists at all.</para>
        <para>So if anyone out there has interest in helping maintaining 11.1 and/or 11.2 please
          contact us through our <ulink url="http://lists.rosenauer.org/mailman/listinfo/evergreen">mailinglist</ulink> or contact me directly.</para>

        </title>
        <para><ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Byunashko">Bryen</ulink> just opened an <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/311039">interesting feature request about a review of the current openSUSE trademark guidelines (#311039).</ulink>
        </para>
        <para>The current state of things is that Novell owns the openSUSE and openSUSE related
          trademarks (which include things like the openSUSE name and the openSUSE branding). While
          at some point I would love to see those trademarks go into the ownership of the openSUSE
          foundation (but let&apos;s first actually have that foundation ;)), it is better to keep
          them with Novell until we have a properly working and funded foundation, because owning
          trademarks is also an obligation to enforce them. And that potentially means legal
          enforcement as well. </para>
        <para>As the trademarks are owned and enforced by Novell, permissions to use trademarked
          material must be sent to Novell (<email>permission@novell.com</email>, actually), but in
          practice, Novell&apos;s legal team has been delegating the responsibility of evaluating
          such requests to the openSUSE board. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, the board has to take decisions within a certain framework. Part of that
          framework, obviously, are a few legal aspects, but more prominently, it is what is
          currently defined in the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Trademark_guidelines">openSUSE Trademark Guidelines</ulink> document. </para>
        <para>Bryen&apos;s feature request (which is essentially filed as such because <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate">openFATE</ulink> gives us a good tool for
          transparency and collecting feedback) is precisely about that point: let&apos;s take a
          step back and rethink our trademark guidelines. </para>
        <para>The task isn&apos;t as simple as it might sound, of course, as we have to find a good

          <para>Every single bug or feature that anyone has developed for GRUB 0.97 has been

            going to go away. The code itself isn&apos;t well written or well maintained. Adding a
            new feature involves jumping through a lot of hoops that may or may not work even if you
            manage to work around all the runtime limitations. For example, a fs implementation has
            a static buffer it can use for memory management. It&apos;s only 32k. For complex file
            systems, or even a simple journaled file system, we run into problems (like the reiserfs
            taking forever to load bug) because we don&apos;t have enough memory to do block mapping
            for the journal so it needs to scan it for every metadata read. (Yeah, really.)

              Update by Default</ulink>
          </title>
          <para>My suggestion is to enable multiversion kernel &amp; preserve running kernel for
            safer kernel updates, to reduce support problems when new kernels won't boot. This is
            now possible for 12.1 by 1 line change to zypp.conf.Since Online Update was first
            introduced (SuSE 7.1?) it replaced the running kernel by default, which can lead to
            problems booting. For a while multiversion kernel has been supported by libzypp (1 line
            edit in zypp.conf). The drawback with multiversion was manual deletion required of
            unwanted kernel packages (see <ulink
              url="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2011-07/msg00056.html"
              >http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2011-07/msg00056.html</ulink> ). Now in
            Factory 12.1 M3 Michel Marek has included &amp; announced - kernel package retention
            options (see
            http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/07/14/improved-kernel-package-retention-in-12-1/ ).The
            default is sane, to preserve the Lastest &amp; Running Kernels. So lets use it and make
            12.1 kernel updates safer for all, and by default do the right thing!</para>

          </title>
          <para>I'd like to have a simple way to have the ssh-agent load a number of keys
            automatically when I log in to the system. The simplest way in my opinion would be a
            directory, say ~/.ssh/ssh-add/, where the user can copy all the keys he wants to
            add. </para>
          <para>Currently ssh-agent is already started when the user logs in using X11 by
            /etc/X11/xdm/sys.xsession. /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc which runs a bit later also executes
            scripts in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/. To me this seems the perfect place to add a small
            script containing the following
            lines:<screen>#!/bin/bash if test -S
"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" -a \ -x
"$SSH_ASKPASS" -a \ -d ~/.ssh/ssh-add;
  then ssh-add ~/.ssh/ssh-add/* &lt;

        <para>Our first agenda item was for discussion of our experiences with 12.1 MS3. As this
          release was not available at that time, our discussion was limited. </para>
        <para>Our second agenda item concerned our request to rename MS6 to Beta in hopes of
          increasing the number of testers in the critical late stages of testing. As reported last
          week, Stephan Kulow, the Release Manager, has agreed to make the name change although he
          doubts that it will make much difference. He also asked how we will measure the effect of
          this change. </para>
        <para>We then discussed what metrics we might use to test the effectiveness of the name
          change. Thus far, only the number of downloads and the number of bug reports have been
          proposed. If you have any other suggestions, please send them to me. An interesting look
          at the number of bugs reported against release can be seen at http://tinyurl.com/3mbrine
          for all versions since 11.2. The decrease in bugs against the Final makes it look as if we
          are doing something right. Of course, all statistics are lies! </para>
        <para>Our final item of discussion was planning our next Open Bugs Day, which will be held
          on August 21, 2011 from 0:00 to 23:59 UTC. This date is 10 days after the scheduled
          release of 12.1 MS4. The emphasis will be on testing whether bugs reported for 11.4 are
          still in 12.1. They will be fixed if possible, or updated to reflect the fact that they
          still exist. All individuals interested in making 12.1 be an exceptionally good release
          are welcome. As we get closer to the date, more specific instructions will be posted. As
          usual, we will have special on-line tools to help you select a bug for investigation. </para>

	MPlayer + VDPAU + Divx = Fail

    <para>
      Here's a thread where the thread starter has an issue with playing some divx movies using Mplayer en NVIDIA's VDPAU technology. A conversation to discover where the cause of this problem might be hidden starts, different NVIDIA cards give different results, if you've seen this issue on your system, this is the stuff you should read.

       How can I transfer my Opensuse installation to another computer?

    <para>
      This one starts with a quite clear statement of what the user wants to achieve. He's added a lot to the default install and is looking for a way to get the same install working in a virtual machine for some friends. After reading this thread, you will know there's lots of ways, not only to virtual machines, also to "real" ones.

    <para>
      When setting up a new system for a lot of users, all the users should be added to the system to have access to it. And they may need to belong to multiple groups. If all this information is available in a text file, could they be added all at once? This is linux, so yes. Interesting read, with a lot of nice examples of what shell scripts can do for you.

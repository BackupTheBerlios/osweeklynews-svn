  <title>openSUSE Forums - We celebrate the release of 11.4</title>

	 openSUSE 11.4 – A New Hallmark For The openSUSE Project
	</ulink></title>
    <para>
      It's the same like with every release: a bit like waiting for your birthday present, whilst knowing what it is. No surprise, yet a surprise. What can we say, the title says it all. On behalf of the openSUSE forums, I'd like to express our gratitude to all that made openSUSE 11.4 happen, and to the community for each and everyone's contributions. A great release.

      <para>
      Like with a lot of previous releases our valued global moderator oldcpu has started a thread for new opensuse users, that people should read before installing. It contains lots of links to forums posts, faqs and howto's. Not only useful in a preinstallation stage, it's a place where lots of forums members return for this wonderful collection of information.  </para>

      Member yasar11732 has posted this survey/poll, we will probably see more. This is a time of vibrance in the forums (and the community). Read the thread to see the votes and the motifs for voting.

      Follow up on last week's item on openSUSE 12.1 Milestone 1, on the 22nd of June, Milestone 2 was released. Again: Please be warned: Milestone releases are for testing purposes, not for production use. On the other hand: if you want to test, go ahead, and help the community by doing so. This is a thread where users share their experiences in testing the Milestone 2 release. <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap">Here's the openSUSE Roadmap</ulink>

      Here's a bit of a strange repository problem. A user cannot get rid of one of his repositories. Nice read, some zypper basics.

      Lots of times, when posting on the forums, users are asked to copy output of commands invoked in a terminal window in their forums posts. This to provide others with information about settings, drivers, versions etc etc. To improve readability of this output it's almost a requirement to post this in CODE TAGS. Here's the guide to do this by our admin caf4926.

    </title>
    <para>
      The development of openSUSE 12.1 has gone past the Milestones stage, and has now achieved Beta status. As usual there's a lot of activity around this in the forums. If you're interested in the comments. reports etc by forums members testing the release, this is the thread to watch. Some solutions for current issues can be found here as well.

    </title>
    <para>
      It's already a while ago, that we were presented with openSUSE Tumbleweed, the rolling release version of openSUSE. Also a while ago, that KDE 4.7 was released. Yet, there's still no KDE 4.7 in Tumbleweed, using the KDE:/Release: repos is not the way to go. Greg Kroah Hartman, maintainer of Tumbleweed, stated in one of the forums threads that there are some issues in KDE 4.7 that keep it from being in Tumbleweed. So, patience seems to be the best for now. Greg will probably let us know, when things get cleared.

    <para>
      The title says it all. Adobe released a 64bit version of their Flash player 11. Some members report erronious behaviour, others, like me, have no issues. Read the thread to find out about the details

      The process to have the next openSUSE release has opened to the public with the release of the first Milestone. Our admin caf4926 started a thread a while ago, and it's a good thing to give it some attention here. Please be warned: Milestone releases are for testing purposes, not for production use. On the other hand: if you want to test, go ahead, and help the community by doing so. The roadmap to openSUSE 12.1 -yep, that's what it's going to be versioned- is <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap">here</ulink>

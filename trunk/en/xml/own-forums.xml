    </title>
    <para>
      The reason I'm mentioning this thread is because it contains a lot of information on GRUB, the default bootloader, the piece of software allowing you to boot multiple operating systems, most used: a dual-boot with some Windows flavor. Our member @nrickert uses a special configuration, with some unexpected, or unwanted results. In the meantime Milestone 3 gets involved as well.

    <para>
      A returning conversation in our Chit-Chat subforum: "Why do other members use openSUSE". No matter how often this question has already been asked, always interesting to read people's motivation to use openSUSE. Take your time to read and let others know what brings or brought you to openSUSE.

      An answer first: Yes, kernel 3.0 is available for openSUSE, for those who want to try it it's in the Kernel: repos, and as per today it's the kernel for openSUSE Tumbleweed, This thread started before Linus Torvalds officially released the new kernel, but there are those who test/try the release candidates.

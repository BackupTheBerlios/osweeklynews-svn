      XP first? openSUSE first?

      A question, asked a lot in the <ulink url="http://forums.opensuse.org">openSUSE Forums</ulink>. This member needs to have both openSUSE and XP installed on a fresh new disk. The replies not only supply the answer to this question, they also help the thread's starter to a good partitioning scheme of the new disk.

      >Network printer kills internet connection</ulink></title>
    <para>
      A nice example of a good thread opener: a clear title, a good description of what happens. Quote: "After setting up to print using wireless access, printing works fine, there is however no longer any internet access available, wired or wireless ( from PCLOS, Mandriva, openSUSE, win7, or whatever!) To restore internet access requires rebooting the router and turning off the printer (or disabling its networking) similar issues with wired network printing."

      This forum of the <ulink url="http://forums.opensuse.org">openSUSE Forums</ulink>is a subforum of <ulink url="http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-help-here/">Get Help Here</ulink>. Top thread on the list is a "sticky" : <ulink url="http://forums.opensuse.org/english/get-help-here/wireless/410319-getting-your-wireless-work.html">Getting your wireless to work </ulink>, it's writen in 2009, but still a very good set of instructions and explanations. Does your card not work after following this, use the search function of the forums, search for the brand of the wifi device. Chances are high you find a post that leads to a working device.

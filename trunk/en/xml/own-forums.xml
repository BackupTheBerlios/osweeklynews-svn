    <para>
      This is a repeat from last week. openSUSE 12.1 is new, we still like to draw your attention to this article in the New User HOWTO/FAQ subforums. Like with every openSUSE release our admin oldcpu has prepared a document for new users to read before starting to install openSUSE 12.1. If you're new to openSUSE, this is a must-read, if you're already an openSUSE user, even very experienced, the article still deserves your attention.

    <para>
    openSUSE 12.1 is out for a week now, title says it all: an extensive thread on user experiences and opinions. The overall impression is that 12.1 is a very nice and stable release. For some users there maybe issues/lack of knowledge on the new features, but hey, we have the choice, for example to keep on using sysvinit instead of systemd. Interesting read.

    </title>
    <para>
      Another rerun of a subject. A user reports a broken Chromium install. I'm selecting this thread because the start of the thread is an excellent example of a well documented post. The user copied and pasted relevant output in his initial post, which makes giving support/helping out easy. For those experiencing instabilities in Chromium: the packages you should have are no longer provided through the Contrib repos, they're now in the "network:" repos: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/chromium/ . Open the URL in a browser, then click the link for your openSUSE version, then copy and paste the URL and add it as a repo.

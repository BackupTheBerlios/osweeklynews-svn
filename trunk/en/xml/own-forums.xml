    <para>
      We'd like to draw your attention to this article in the New User HOWTO/FAQ subforums. Like with every openSUSE release our admin oldcpu has prepared a document for new users to read before starting to install openSUSE 12.1. If you're new to openSUSE, this is a must-read, if you're already an openSUSE user, even very experienced, the article still deserves your attention.

      Now that openSUSE 12.1 is released we (will) see a lot of posts in the title our subforum "Install - Boot - Login". The next couple of weeks I will present you with a selection of threads on installing / configuring openSUSE 12.1, just as an overview of posts in this area, concerning the latest release. Personally I did not run into any issues during install, it was very smooth, but if you are, this subforum is the place to be.

      Another rerun of a subject. A user reports a broken Chromium install. I'm selecting this thread because the start of the thread is an excellent example of a well documented post. The user copied and pasted relevant output in his initial post, which makes giving support/helping out easy. For those experiencing instabilities in Chromium: the packages you should have are no longer provided through the Contrib repos, they're now in the "network:" repos: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/chromium/ . Open the URL in a browser, then click the link for your openSUSE version, then copy and paste the URL and add it as a repo.

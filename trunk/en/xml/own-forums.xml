      Sometimes certain tools get deprecated, or become obsolete (to most of us). Up until openSUSE 11.2 we had to configure the X server -for our graphical desktop- by running SaX2 from the console in runlevel 3. Quite a hurdle for new users. After that autodetection and configuration entered openSUSE, so SaX2 is no longer maintained as a component of a default openSUSE install. This thread is opened by a user who does want SaX2 for a reason.

      A couple of editions ago I presented a thread about the debate Upgrade vs. Clean Install. Here's an example where users upgraded and ran into trouble. A lot of possible causes are mentioned, if you have trouble like these, read ahead and find some good pointers to what you might do.

      Some question...I tend to say most of us answer NO. Yet an interesting thread, a firm discussion. Where a lot of background is given by some of our members.

      Here's a user reporting continuous failure of his DVD download. The causes for this can be many, but there's always a way out. Read some good advice.

      Same as last week, yet I don't want to miss the opportunity to draw attention to this subforum. It's hosting quite some threads on the 12.1 RC's, of which RC2 was released yesterday. In my humble opninion the place to look if you're going to install openSUSE 12.1. A lot of info is given on issues, problems -which should be fixed in the release-, nice success stories.

      Not much to add to the title of this survey. Nice read if you're interested on our members' comments in the thread.

      Another rerun of a subject. A user reports a broken Chromium install. I'm selecting this thread because the start of the thread is an excellent example of a well documented post. The user copied and pasted relevant output in his initial post, which makes giving support/helping out easy. For those experiencing instabilities in Chromium: the packages you should have are no longer provided through the Contrib repos, they're now in the "network:" repos: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/chromium/ . Open the URL in a browser, then click the link for your openSUSE version, then copy and paste the URL and add it as a repo.

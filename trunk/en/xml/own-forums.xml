    <para>
      The title this time is not a link to a single thread, but to the Pre-release/Beta subforums. Reason for this is the growing number of threads concerning the upcoming release of openSUSE 12.1. More and more people are starting to try and test the RC1, reporting issues, or complete success. Until the official release this subforum will be the one to watch if you're interested in user experience, problems etc.

    <para>
      Not all of us have a high speed, stable internet connection. This thread reports download errors, which result in corrupted iso files, install media not passing the media verification etc. Bypassing a corrupt download is not possible, sometimes it can lead to unwanted surprising results. There's a couple of posts in this thread with useful tips for those users who meet trouble in this area.

      The openSUSE forums are the place where support in using openSUSE can be found. Here we have an example of what "support" can imply. A user asks the other members for advice on buying a new video card. There are numerous sites to check hardware compatibility for linux, but this is a nice way as well, just ask the others for their suggestions.

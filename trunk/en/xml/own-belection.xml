    <para>TL;DR: openSUSE as a project needs to raise its game, and the next openSUSE Board can
      guide the project to agree a tight set of goals for our releases and work to a higher standard
      on them. Otherwise we risk being an undirected mess of pet projects, bikeshedding discussions
      and bickering tribes.</para>

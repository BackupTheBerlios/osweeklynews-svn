        >Nelson Marques: A new aeon, a new team of ambassadors!</ulink></title>
    <para>For a long time that I actively search the Portuguese Ambassadors… unfortunately I was unable to find them. I’ve learned once with someone which is very dear to me a single line that ended up by translating one great universal truth: “Stopping is dying”.</para>
    <para>This afternoon, I’ve traveled northeast to the beautiful city of Oliveira de Azemeis, where I’ve met one of the unknown faces of the Portuguese openSUSE Community, João Matias. We’ve had a small chat about several topics… amongst them:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>OBS – openSUSE Build Service – howto, examples and how useful it can be for students
          projects!</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>University Campus – Event creaton… how openSUSE can represent itself on 3rd parties
          events inside of the campus;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Concerns about the growth of the Portuguese Community;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The new ‘Portuguese’ Forum at forums.opensuse.org (Special Thanks to Jim Henderson and

      <listitem>
        <para>Christmas Dinner @ 11th December and hot-topics.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>We look forward to a smiling future full of work and hopefully with a stronger openSUSE
      presence in the Portuguese University Campus.</para>

        Marques: Indicator ME has landed!</ulink></title>
    <para>The first package I pushed to openSUSE was Notify OSD (Canonicals Notification
      Agent/Bubble) with a small patch for extended features (skinning/theming) maintained by Roman
      Sukochev. This patch is popular and wasn’t merged with Notify OSD because it ‘breaks’ the spec
      of Notify OSD that states it shouldn’t be skinnable/themable on Ubuntu. </para>
    <para>Now I’ve packaged a lot of dependencies… cracked and patched GTK with a patch taken from
      Ubuntu, spended hours of mind crushing frustration…. but finally it has landed! The first
      ‘Indicator’ has landed… Often known as “Ubuntu Me Menu”, under openSUSE it will be known as
      ‘indicator-me’.</para>

    <para>This screenshot was taken on openSUSE Factory 11.4 Milestone 4. It’s a clean install with
      Sonar and the only tweak is the Faenza-Dark icon theme, which I also packaged and pushed to
      openSUSE:Contrib. <xref linkend="fig.indicator"/></para>
    <para>Top right corner… Indicator ME on openSUSE. It works… I won’t backport it and will only
      maintain it from 11.4 forward. I’m doing this for personal reasons, mainly to become an
      alternative on a localized openSUSE Spin that will be named ‘openSUSE IBERIA’, which was
      already taken into openSUSE-Project by Javier Llorente. </para>
    <para>The main reason to bring this to openSUSE and into IBERIA is tightly related to the fact
      that most people on the Iberian Peninsula use Ubuntu, so we find the best approach possible to
      offer something as close as Ubuntu and hopefully even a better offer when it comes to
      localization. We don’t want to make of openSUSE a ‘clone’ of Ubuntu, instead we want to make
      the openSUSE experience more close to what people already use. </para>
    <para>I’m also going to post a small pic of the same software, this time with Canonical’s
      Radiance Theme, which introduces a small ‘tab’ like visual on the bar. This theme is awesome…
      regardless of what people think of Ubuntu and Canonical… This is the kind of polishing that
      makes Canonical successful, not just the ‘marketing’ many point and even despise.</para>

    </figure>
    <para>Indicator ME as landed… soon others will follow… My plans are to submit this pieces of
      software to GNOME:Apps, and not to push as default, but instead offer them at the distance of
      a ‘zypper in package’ to the openSUSE users out there. And at the same time, since the
      libraries behind it are also packaged… be more attractive to developers who might want to use
      them. I see no loss neither an identity crisis on openSUSE by providing more packages and
      alternative software to improve users Desktop experience… <xref linkend="fig.indicator1"/></para>

        Blogged about: Smeegol Status - 08Dec10</ulink></title>
    <para>Looks like it's been a while since I mentioned anything about our dear friend Smeegol –
      sorry. </para>
    <para>As most will know MeeGo made a couple of releases: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>1.0.5 mostly an update to their original release</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>1.1.0 the new release with new API, and renaming most packages</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>So where is Smeegol? Well we're pretty much there, although not 100%. I have
      1.0.5 all built and packaged including an image. Problem is I seem to have hit a bug with
      network-manager-netbook – it doesn't seem to be displaying networks which is a fairly
      fundamental issue :-( </para>
    <para>I have also got 1.1.0 built, but for factory only atm – I'm having some issues with
      tracker on 11.3. Problem is when I try and run the image, I basically have an unusable system
      thanks to some Gconf fubar but I don't really know what. </para>
    <para>You may have also noticed that I'm still calling it Smeegol ;-) Well the simple reason is
      I have requested clarification from MeeGo, Nokia, Intel and the Linux Foundation and so far
      I've received bubkiss!! I heard loads of talk from the recent MeeGo Conference about how open
      MeeGo was, but it seems that they are only open to partners who can help them make money; not
      open to the wider community. I am not alone in waiting for a response from them, Fedora and
      Debian are also in limbo waiting for information/clarification and general communication from
      them. The difference between us is the fact that in openSUSE if you want something done the
      best way is to Just Do It :-) </para>
    <para>So in a nutshell, before I make an official release of either I need people to test and
      report back to me what does and doesn't work. I haven't tried doing an upgrade from 1.0.3 to
      1.0.5 or 1.1.0 so maybe someone could try that. Jump onto #opensuse-moblin on Freenode or the
      opensuse-goblin mailing list and let's continue to be trail blazers. Yes I know I need to
      align the mailing list and irc channel names, but I'm waiting for a conclusion to the name
      debacle first. </para>
    <para>I would really love to get both releases out as a little christmas present to you the
      community, so who's up for some festive fun?</para>

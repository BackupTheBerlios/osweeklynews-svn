      >openSUSE poster and Free Software Calendar 2011 with Linux Magazin</ulink></title>
    <para>The Januari edition of the German <ulink url="http://www.linux-magazin.de">Linux-Magazin</ulink> this year will feature something this Magazine has not featured for almost 10 years: a Free Software Event calendar. Sponsored by SUSE, this calendar features many of the upcoming Free Software events in 2011 mingled with interesting tidbits about Linux and Unix history! While this geeky piece of paper (offering the date and time of events in unix time) is cool, the back offers an even more exciting layer of ink: Beer! Our very own Robert Lihm, openSUSE artist Extra-Ordinaire has taken a picture of the <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Beer">famous “Old Toad” beer</ulink>, featured at the openSUSE conference. Uttering the infamous words “A good beer is a good beer”, he decided this would form a good foundation for a poster. Hence, everyone who gets his or her hands on this first 2011 edition of Linux-Magazin can use the back of this Calendar to show how much beer and openSUSE go together (read more about the beer).
      The Linux-Magazin folks have also thought about those for whom German is not a first language – they have made an English translation of the Calendar and the graphics for both Calendar and Poster are available on the openSUSE wiki for re-print under liberal licensing terms – the magazine is for sale now, get it or just <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Marketing_materials#Folders_and_leaflets">download and print the calendars and of course the awesome poster</ulink>! For the poster we hope to have sources online soon, if you want them now, ask Robert Lihm!<xref linkend="fig.toad"/>

        >Updating openSUSE Manuals for openSUSE 11.4</ulink></title>
    <para>With the openSUSE distribution, we have a set of openSUSE manuals and QuickStart guides.
      You can read them online via <ulink url="http://doc.opensuse.org"
        >http://doc.opensuse.org</ulink>. They are installed by default on your system so you can
        access them there as well. </para>

    <para>For openSUSE 11.4, we face the usual challenge of updating the manuals: The documentation
      writers know what’s in the manuals but do not know everything that’s changed and the
      developers know what’s changed but may not know all the manuals. For openSUSE 11.4, I created
        <ulink url="https://features.opensuse.org/310944">feature 310944</ulink> Read the
      documentation at doc.opensuse.orgin openFATE which will be the one reference point for
      documentation. Please add there things that need to be changed in the manuals. I’ve already
      added a few things that came to mind. <xref linkend="fig.docs"/></para>
    <para>The Novell<ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Documentation_team"> documentation
        team</ulink> will concentrate on updating the Startup Guide, the GNOME and KDE Quick Guides
      and the Reference guide. They plan to also add a short chapter on the top use cases so that
      for example new users know to use LibreOffice as their Office Suite and where to find more
      information about it. </para>
    <para>If anybody is interested in helping improve the documentation, please reach out to the
      documentation team on the opensuse-doc mailing list or on IRC on the #opensuse-doc channel on
      the freenode network. You can also find the sources of the manuals at <ulink
        url="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/"
        >https://developer.berlios.de/projects/opensuse-doc/</ulink>.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Call for help</emphasis> Please add to <ulink
        url="https://features.opensuse.org/310944">feature 310944</ulink> new comments that explain
      what needs to be changed in the manuals for openSUSE 11.4.</para>
